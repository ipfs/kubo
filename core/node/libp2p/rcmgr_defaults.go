// This file defines implicit limit defaults used when Swarm.ResourceMgr.Enabled

// createDefaultLimitConfig creates LimitConfig to pass to libp2p's resource manager.
// libp2p's resource manager provides tremendous flexibility but also adds a lot of complexity.
// The intent of the default config here is to provide good defaults,
// and where the defaults aren't good enough,
// to expose a good set of higher-level "knobs" to users to satisfy most use cases
// without requiring users to wade into all the intricacies of libp2p's resource manager.
//
// The inputs one can specify in SwarmConfig are:
//   - cfg.ResourceMgr.MaxMemory:  This is the max amount of memory in bytes to allow libp2p to use.
//     libp2p's resource manager will prevent additional resource creation while this limit is hit.
//     If this value isn't specified, 1/8th of the total system memory is used.
//   - cfg.ResourceMgr.MaxFileDescriptors:  This is the maximum number of file descriptors to allow libp2p to use.
//     libp2p's resource manager will prevent additional file descriptor consumption while this limit is hit.
//     If this value isn't specified, the maximum between 1/2 of system FD limit and 4096 is used.
//   - Swarm.ConnMgr.HighWater: If a connection manager is specified, libp2p's resource manager
//     will allow 2x more connections than the HighWater mark
//     so the connection manager has "space and time" to close "least useful" connections.
//
// With these inputs defined, limits are created at the system, transient, and peer scopes.
// Other scopes are ignored (by being set to infinity).
// The reason these scopes are chosen is because:
//   - system - This gives us the coarse-grained control we want so we can reason about the system as a whole.
//     It is the backstop, and allows us to reason about resource consumption more easily
//     since don't have think about the interaction of many other scopes.
//   - transient - Limiting connections that are in process of being established provides backpressure so not too much work queues up.
//   - peer - The peer scope doesn't protect us against intentional DoS attacks.
//     It's just as easy for an attacker to send 100 requests/second with 1 peerId vs. 10 requests/second with 10 peers.
//     We are reliant on the system scope for protection here in the malicious case.
//     The reason for having a peer scope is to protect against unintentional DoS attacks
//     (e.g., bug in a peer which is causing it to "misbehave").
//     In the unintional case, we want to make sure a "misbehaving" node doesn't consume more resources than necessary.
//
// Within these scopes, limits are just set on memory, FD, and inbound connections/streams.
// Limits are set based on the inputs above.
// We trust this node to behave properly and thus ignore outbound connection/stream limits.
// We apply any limits that libp2p has for its protocols/services
// since we assume libp2p knows best here.
//
// This leaves 3 levels of resource management protection:
//  1. The user who does nothing and uses defaults - In this case they get some sane defaults
//     based on the amount of memory and file descriptors their system has.
//     This should protect the node from many attacks.
//  2. Slightly more advanced user - They can tweak the above by passing in config on
//     maxMemory, maxFD, or maxConns with Swarm.HighWater.ConnMgr.
//  3. Power user - They specify all the limits they want set via Swarm.ResourceMgr.Limits
//     and we don't do any defaults/overrides. We pass that config blindly into libp2p resource manager.
