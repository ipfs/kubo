        Suggest a new feature in Kubo (the program). If you'd like to suggest an improvement to the IPFS protocol, please discuss it on [the forum](https://discuss.ipfs.io).

        Issues in this repo must be specific, actionable, and well motivated. They should be starting points for _building_ new features, not brainstorming ideas.

        If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, please open a new thread on [the forum](https://discuss.ipfs.io).

        **Example:**

        > Add deduplication-optimized chunking of tar files in `ipfs add` (specific) by examining tar headers ... (actionable). This would let me efficiently store and update many versions of code archives (motivated).
