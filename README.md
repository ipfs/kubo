## What is Kubo?

Kubo was the first IPFS implementation and is the most widely used one today. Implementing the *Interplanetary Filesystem* - the Web3 standard for content-addressing, interoperable with HTTP. Thus powered by IPLD's data models and the libp2p for network communication. Kubo is written in Go.

Featureset
- Runs an IPFS-Node as a network service
- [Command Line Interface](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/) to IPFS-Nodes
- Local [Web2-to-Web3 HTTP Gateway functionality](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/http-gateways#readme) 
- HTTP RPC API (`/api/v0`) to access and control the daemon
- IPFS's internal Webgui can be used to manage the Kubo nodes

### Other implementations

See [List](https://docs.ipfs.tech/basics/ipfs-implementations/)

## What is IPFS?

IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas from previous systems such as Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built-in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.

## Security Issues

Please follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Install

The canonical download instructions for IPFS are over at: https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/. It is **highly recommended** you follow those instructions if you are not interested in working on IPFS development.

### System Requirements

IPFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores (kubo is highly parallel). On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.

If your system is resource-constrained, we recommend:

1. Installing OpenSSL and rebuilding kubo manually with `make build GOTAGS=openssl`. See the [download and compile](#download-and-compile-ipfs) section for more information on compiling kubo.
2. Initializing your daemon with `ipfs init --profile=lowpower`

### Docker

Official images are published at https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/:

[![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ipfs/kubo?color=blue&label=kubo%20docker%20image&logo=docker&sort=semver&style=flat-square&cacheSeconds=3600)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/)

More info on how to run Kubo (go-ipfs) inside Docker can be found [here](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/run-ipfs-inside-docker/).

### Official prebuilt binaries

The official binaries are published at https://dist.ipfs.tech#kubo:

[![dist.ipfs.tech Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ipfs/kubo?label=dist.ipfs.tech&logo=ipfs&style=flat-square&cacheSeconds=3600)](https://dist.ipfs.tech#kubo)

From there:
- Click the blue "Download Kubo" on the right side of the page.
- Open/extract the archive.
- Move kubo (`ipfs`) to your path (`install.sh` can do it for you).

If you are unable to access [dist.ipfs.tech](https://dist.ipfs.tech#kubo), you can also download kubo (go-ipfs) from:
- this project's GitHub [releases](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/latest) page
- `/ipns/dist.ipfs.tech` at [dweb.link](https://dweb.link/ipns/dist.ipfs.tech#kubo) gateway

#### Updating

##### Using ipfs-update

IPFS has an updating tool that can be accessed through `ipfs update`. The tool is
not installed alongside IPFS in order to keep that logic independent of the main
codebase. To install `ipfs-update` tool, [download it here](https://dist.ipfs.tech/#ipfs-update).

##### Downloading builds using IPFS

List the available versions of Kubo (go-ipfs) implementation:

```console
$ ipfs cat /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/versions
```

Then, to view available builds for a version from the previous command (`$VERSION`):

```console
$ ipfs ls /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION
```

To download a given build of a version:

```console
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_darwin-386.tar.gz    # darwin 32-bit build
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_darwin-amd64.tar.gz  # darwin 64-bit build
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_freebsd-amd64.tar.gz # freebsd 64-bit build
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_linux-386.tar.gz     # linux 32-bit build
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_linux-amd64.tar.gz   # linux 64-bit build
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_linux-arm.tar.gz     # linux arm build
$ ipfs get /ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/$VERSION/kubo_$VERSION_windows-amd64.zip    # windows 64-bit build
```

### Build from Source

![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/ipfs/kubo?label=Requires%20Go&logo=go&style=flat-square&cacheSeconds=3600)

kubo's build system requires Go and some standard POSIX build tools:

* GNU make
* Git
* GCC (or some other go compatible C Compiler) (optional)

To build without GCC, build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` (e.g., `make build CGO_ENABLED=0`).

#### Install Go

![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/ipfs/kubo?label=Requires%20Go&logo=go&style=flat-square&cacheSeconds=3600)

If you need to update: [Download latest version of Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

You'll need to add Go's bin directories to your `$PATH` environment variable e.g., by adding these lines to your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

(If you run into trouble, see the [Go install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)).

#### Download and Compile IPFS

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ipfs/kubo.git

$ cd kubo
$ make install
```

Alternatively, you can run `make build` to build the go-ipfs binary (storing it in `cmd/ipfs/ipfs`) without installing it.

**NOTE:** If you get an error along the lines of "fatal error: stdlib.h: No such file or directory", you're missing a C compiler. Either re-run `make` with `CGO_ENABLED=0` or install GCC.

##### Cross Compiling

Compiling for a different platform is as simple as running:

```
make build GOOS=myTargetOS GOARCH=myTargetArchitecture
```

##### OpenSSL

To build go-ipfs with OpenSSL support, append `GOTAGS=openssl` to your `make` invocation. Building with OpenSSL should significantly reduce the background CPU usage on nodes that frequently make or receive new connections.

Note: OpenSSL requires CGO support and, by default, CGO is disabled when cross-compiling. To cross-compile with OpenSSL support, you must:

1. Install a compiler toolchain for the target platform.
2. Set the `CGO_ENABLED=1` environment variable.

#### Troubleshooting

- Separate [instructions are available for building on Windows](docs/windows.md).
- `git` is required in order for `go get` to fetch all dependencies.
- Package managers often contain out-of-date `golang` packages.
  Ensure that `go version` reports at least 1.10. See above for how to install go.
- If you are interested in development, please install the development
dependencies as well.
- Shell command completions can be generated with one of the `ipfs commands completion` subcommands. Read [docs/command-completion.md](docs/command-completion.md) to learn more.
- See the [misc folder](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/tree/master/misc) for how to connect IPFS to systemd or whatever init system your distro uses.

## Getting Started

### Usage

[![docs: Command-line quick start](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=docs&message=Command-line%20quick%20start&color=blue&style=flat-square&cacheSeconds=3600)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/)
[![docs: Command-line reference](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=docs&message=Command-line%20reference&color=blue&style=flat-square&cacheSeconds=3600)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/)

To start using IPFS, you must first initialize IPFS's config files on your
system, this is done with `ipfs init`. See `ipfs init --help` for information on
the optional arguments it takes. After initialization is complete, you can use
`ipfs mount`, `ipfs add` and any of the other commands to explore!

### Some things to try

Basic proof of 'ipfs working' locally:

    echo "hello world" > hello
    ipfs add hello
    # This should output a hash string that looks something like:
    # QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
    ipfs cat <that hash>

### HTTP/RPC clients

For programmatic interaction with Kubo, see our [list of HTTP/RPC clients](docs/http-rpc-clients.md).

### Troubleshooting

If you have previously installed IPFS before and you are running into problems getting a newer version to work, try deleting (or backing up somewhere else) your IPFS config directory (~/.ipfs by default) and rerunning `ipfs init`. This will reinitialize the config file to its defaults and clear out the local datastore of any bad entries.

### CLI, HTTP-API, Architecture Diagram

![](./docs/cli-http-api-core-diagram.png)

> [Origin](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/pull/678#discussion_r210410924)

Description: Dotted means "likely going away". The "Legacy" parts are thin wrappers around some commands to translate between the new system and the old system. The grayed-out parts on the "daemon" diagram are there to show that the code is all the same, it's just that we turn some pieces on and some pieces off depending on whether we're running on the client or the server.

### Testing

```
make test
```

### Development Dependencies

If you make changes to the protocol buffers, you will need to install the [protoc compiler](https://github.com/google/protobuf).
