### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

##### `Routing.IgnoreProviders`

This new option allows ignoring specific peer IDs when returned by the content
routing system as providers of content. See the
[documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingignoreproviders)
for for information.

##### New DAG-shaping options when adding

We now allow controlling the default maximum number of links when adding content and building DAGs. There are two new `ipfs add` options:

  - `--max-links`: controls the maximum number of children that a file or a directory can have. Directories will be converted to HAMT-based directories when they have more than the given numbers of children.
  - `--max-hamt-fanout`: controls the maximum number of children that HAMT internal nodes can have.

Both options can be set permanently using the [corresponding `Import` settings](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importmaxlinks).
