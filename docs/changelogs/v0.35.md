### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Dedicated `Reprovider.Strategy` for MFS

The [Mutable File System (MFS)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#mfs) in Kubo is a UnixFS filesystem managed with [`ipfs files`](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/#ipfs-files) commands. It supports familiar file operations like cp and mv within a folder-tree structure, automatically updating a MerkleDAG and a "root CID" that reflects the current MFS state. Files in MFS are protected from garbage collection, offering a simpler alternative to `ipfs pin`. This makes it a popular choice for tools like [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) and the [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/#readme).

Previously, the `pinned` reprovider strategy required manual pin management: each dataset update meant pinning the new version and unpinning the old one. Now, new strategies—`mfs` and `pinned+mfs`—let users limit announcements to data explicitly placed in MFS. This simplifies updating datasets and announcing only the latest version to the Amino DHT.

Users relying on the `pinned` strategy can switch to `pinned+mfs` and use MFS alone to manage updates and announcements, eliminating the need for manual pinning and unpinning. We hope this makes it easier to publish just the data that matters to you.

See [`Reprovider.Strategy`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reproviderstrategy) for more details.

#### Additional new configuration options

- [`Internal.Bitswap.ProviderSearchMaxResults`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md##internalbitswapprovidersearchmaxresults) for adjusting the maximum number of providers bitswap client should aim at before it stops searching for new ones.
- [`Routing.IgnoreProviders`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingignoreproviders) allows ignoring specific peer IDs when returned by the content routing system as providers of content.

#### Grid view in WebUI

The WebUI, accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui/, now includes support for the grid view on the _Files_ screen:
