### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Opt-in HTTP Retrieval client

This release introduces experimental client support for pure HTTPS block retrieval, supplementing existing Bitswap over Libp2p.

The opt-in client allows Kubo to act on routing system provider results that have `/tls/http` multiaddrs, pointing to HTTPS servers supporting [Trustless HTTP Gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway)'s Block Responses (`?format=raw`, `application/vnd.ipld.raw`). Fetching blocks over HTTPS (HTTP/2) can simplify infrastructure and lower costs for storage providers via HTTP caching and CDNs.

To enable this feature for testing and feedback, set:
```
$ ipfs config --json HTTPRetrieval.Enabled true
```

See [`HTTPRetrieval`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#httpretrieval) for more details, and [IPIP-501](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/501) for ongoing discussion how HTTP provider should announce support on Amino DHT (currently, HTTP results are effectively limited to IPNI results from delegated routing endpoint at `cid.contact`, or one specified via [`IPFS_HTTP_ROUTERS`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md#ipfs_http_routers)).

#### Dedicated `Reprovider.Strategy` for MFS

The [Mutable File System (MFS)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#mfs) in Kubo is a UnixFS filesystem managed with [`ipfs files`](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/#ipfs-files) commands. It supports familiar file operations like cp and mv within a folder-tree structure, automatically updating a MerkleDAG and a "root CID" that reflects the current MFS state. Files in MFS are protected from garbage collection, offering a simpler alternative to `ipfs pin`. This makes it a popular choice for tools like [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) and the [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/#readme).

Previously, the `pinned` reprovider strategy required manual pin management: each dataset update meant pinning the new version and unpinning the old one. Now, new strategies—`mfs` and `pinned+mfs`—let users limit announcements to data explicitly placed in MFS. This simplifies updating datasets and announcing only the latest version to the Amino DHT.

Users relying on the `pinned` strategy can switch to `pinned+mfs` and use MFS alone to manage updates and announcements, eliminating the need for manual pinning and unpinning. We hope this makes it easier to publish just the data that matters to you.

See [`Reprovider.Strategy`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reproviderstrategy) for more details.

#### Additional new configuration options

- [`Bitswap`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#bitswap) section with `Enabled` and `ServerEnabled` flags determine whether Kubo initializes Bitswap, enabling just the client or both the client and server.
- [`Internal.Bitswap.ProviderSearchMaxResults`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#internalbitswapprovidersearchmaxresults) for adjusting the maximum number of providers bitswap client should aim at before it stops searching for new ones.
- [`Routing.IgnoreProviders`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingignoreproviders) allows ignoring specific peer IDs when returned by the content routing system as providers of content.
- [`Routing.DelegatedRouters`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingdelegatedrouters) allows customizing HTTP routers used by Kubo when `Routing.Type` is set to `auto` or `autoclient`.

#### Grid view in WebUI

The WebUI, accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui/, now includes support for the grid view on the _Files_ screen:

#### Enhanced DAG-Shaping Controls for `ipfs add`

This release advances CIDv1 support by introducing fine-grained control over UnixFS DAG shaping during data ingestion with the `ipfs add` command.

Wider DAG trees (more links per node, higher fanout, larger thresholds) are beneficial for large files and directories with many files, reducing tree depth and lookup latency in high-latency networks, but they increase node size, straining memory and CPU on resource-constrained devices. Narrower trees (lower link count, lower fanout, smaller thresholds) are preferable for smaller directories, frequent updates, or low-power clients, minimizing overhead and ensuring compatibility, though they may increase traversal steps for very large datasets.

Kubo now allows users to act on these tradeoffs and customize the width of the DAG created by `ipfs add` command.

##### New `ipfs add` Options

Three new options allow you to override default settings for specific import operations:

- `--max-file-links`: Sets the maximum number of child links for a single file chunk.
- `--max-directory-links`: Defines the maximum number of child entries in a "basic" (single-chunk) directory.
  - Note: Directories exceeding this limit or the `Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectorySizeThreshold` are converted to HAMT-based (sharded across multiple blocks) structures.
- `--max-hamt-fanout`: Specifies the maximum number of child nodes for HAMT internal structures.

##### Persistent `Import.*` Configuration

You can set default values for these options using the following configuration settings:
- [`Import.UnixFSFileMaxLinks`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfsfilemaxlinks)
- [`Import.UnixFSDirectoryMaxLinks`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfsdirectorymaxlinks)
- [`Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectoryMaxFanout`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfshamtdirectorymaxfanout)
- [`Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectorySizeThreshold`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfshamtdirectorysizethreshold)

##### Updated `Import` Profiles

The release updated configuration [profiles](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#profiles) to incorporate these new `Import.*` settings:
- Updated Profile: `test-cid-v1` now includes current defaults as explicit `Import.UnixFSFileMaxLinks=174`, `Import.UnixFSDirectoryMaxLinks=0`, `Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectoryMaxFanout=256` and `Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectorySizeThreshold=256KiB`
- New Profile: `test-cid-v1-wide` adopts experimental directory DAG-shaping defaults, increasing the maximum file DAG width from 174 to 1024, HAMT fanout from 256 to 1024, and raising the HAMT directory sharding threshold from 256KiB to 1MiB, aligning with 1MiB file chunks.
  - Feedback: Try it out and share your thoughts at [discuss.ipfs.tech/t/should-we-profile-cids](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/should-we-profile-cids/18507) or [ipfs/specs#499](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/499).

> [!TIP]
> Apply one of CIDv1 test [profiles](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#profiles) with `ipfs config profile apply test-cid-v1[-wide]`.

#### `Datastore` Metrics Now Opt-In

To reduce overhead in the default configuration, datastore metrics are no longer enabled by default when initializing a Kubo repository with `ipfs init`.
Metrics prefixed with `<dsname>_datastore` (e.g., `flatfs_datastore_...`, `leveldb_datastore_...`) are not exposed unless explicitly enabled. For a complete list of affected default metrics, refer to [`prometheus_metrics_added_by_measure_profile`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/test/sharness/t0119-prometheus-data/prometheus_metrics_added_by_measure_profile).

Convenience opt-in [profiles](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#profiles) can be enabled at initialization time with `ipfs init --profile`: `flatfs-measure`, `pebbleds-measure`, `badgerds-measure`

It is also possible to manually add the `measure` wrapper. See examples in [`Datastore.Spec`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#datastorespec) documentation.

#### Optimized, dedicated queue for providing fresh CIDs

From `kubo` [`v0.33.0`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.33.0),
Bitswap stopped advertising newly added and received blocks to the DHT. Since
then `boxo/provider` is responsible for the provide and reprovide logic. Prior
to `v0.35.0`, provides and reprovides were handled together in batches, leading
to delays in initial advertisements (provides).

Provides and Reprovides now have separate queues, allowing for immediate
provide of new CIDs and optimised batching of reprovides.

This change introduces a new configuration option for limiting the number of
concurrent provide operations:
[`Provider.WorkerCount`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providerworkercount).

> [!TIP]
> Users who need to provide large volumes of content immediately should consider removing the cap on concurrent provide operations and also set `Routing.AcceleratedDHTClient` to `true`.

##### Deprecated `ipfs stats provider`

Since the `ipfs stats provider` command was displaying statistics for both
provides and reprovides, this command isn't relevant anymore after separating
the two queues.

The successor command is `ipfs stats reprovide`, showing the same statistics,
but for reprovides only.

> [!NOTE]
> `ipfs stats provider` still works, but is marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Be mindful that the command provides only statistics about reprovides (similar to `ipfs stats reprovide`) and not the new provide queue (this will be fixed as a part of wider refactor planned for a future release).

#### Pebble Database Format Config

This Kubo release provides node operators with more control over [Pebble's `FormatMajorVersion`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#format-major-versions). This allows testing a new Kubo release without automatically migrating Pebble datastores, keeping the ability to switch back to older Kubo.

When IPFS is initialized to use the pebbleds datastore (opt-in via `ipfs init --profile=pebbleds`), the latest pebble database format is configured in the pebble datastore config as `"formatMajorVersion"`. Setting this in the datastore config prevents automatically upgrading to the latest available version when Kubo is upgraded. If a later version becomes available, the Kubo daemon prints a startup message to indicate this. The user can them update the config to use the latest format when they are certain a downgrade will not be necessary.

Without the `"formatMajorVersion"` in the pebble datastore config, the database format is automatically upgraded to the latest version. If this happens, then it is possible a downgrade back to the previous version of Kubo will not work if new format is not compatible with the pebble datastore in the previous version of Kubo.

When installing a new version of Kubo when `"formatMajorVersion"` is configured, automatic repository migration (`ipfs daemon with --migrate=true`) does not upgrade this to the latest available version. This is done because a user may have reasons not to upgrade the pebble database format, and may want to be able to downgrade Kubo if something else is not working in the new version. If the configured pebble database format in the old Kubo is not supported in the new Kubo, then the configured version must be updated and the old Kubo run, before installing the new Kubo.

See other caveats and configuration options at [`kubo/docs/datastores.md#pebbleds`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/datastores.md#pebbleds)
