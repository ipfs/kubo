### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Opt-in HTTP Retrieval client

This release introduces experimental client support for pure HTTPS block retrieval, supplementing existing Bitswap over Libp2p.

The opt-in client allows Kubo to act on routing system provider results that have `/tls/http` multiaddrs, pointing to HTTPS servers supporting [Trustless HTTP Gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway)'s Block Responses (`?format=raw`, `application/vnd.ipld.raw`). Fetching blocks over HTTPS (HTTP/2) can simplify infrastructure and lower costs for storage providers via HTTP caching and CDNs.

To enable this feature for testing and feedback, set:
```
$ ipfs config --json HTTPRetrieval.Enabled true
```

See [`HTTPRetrieval`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#httpretrieval) for more details, and [IPIP-501](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/501) for ongoing discussion how HTTP provider should announce support on Amino DHT (currently, HTTP results are effectively limited to IPNI results from delegated routing endpoint at `cid.contact`, or one specified via [`IPFS_HTTP_ROUTERS`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md#ipfs_http_routers)).

#### Dedicated `Reprovider.Strategy` for MFS

The [Mutable File System (MFS)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#mfs) in Kubo is a UnixFS filesystem managed with [`ipfs files`](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/#ipfs-files) commands. It supports familiar file operations like cp and mv within a folder-tree structure, automatically updating a MerkleDAG and a "root CID" that reflects the current MFS state. Files in MFS are protected from garbage collection, offering a simpler alternative to `ipfs pin`. This makes it a popular choice for tools like [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) and the [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/#readme).

Previously, the `pinned` reprovider strategy required manual pin management: each dataset update meant pinning the new version and unpinning the old one. Now, new strategies—`mfs` and `pinned+mfs`—let users limit announcements to data explicitly placed in MFS. This simplifies updating datasets and announcing only the latest version to the Amino DHT.

Users relying on the `pinned` strategy can switch to `pinned+mfs` and use MFS alone to manage updates and announcements, eliminating the need for manual pinning and unpinning. We hope this makes it easier to publish just the data that matters to you.

See [`Reprovider.Strategy`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reproviderstrategy) for more details.

#### Additional new configuration options

- [`Internal.Bitswap.ProviderSearchMaxResults`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md##internalbitswapprovidersearchmaxresults) for adjusting the maximum number of providers bitswap client should aim at before it stops searching for new ones.
- [`Routing.IgnoreProviders`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingignoreproviders) allows ignoring specific peer IDs when returned by the content routing system as providers of content.
- [`Routing.DelegatedRouters`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingdelegatedrouters) allows customizing HTTP routers used by Kubo when `Routing.Type` is set to `auto` or `autoclient`.

#### Grid view in WebUI

The WebUI, accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui/, now includes support for the grid view on the _Files_ screen:

#### Enhanced DAG-Shaping Controls for `ipfs add`

This release advances CIDv1 support by introducing fine-grained control over UnixFS DAG shaping during data ingestion with the `ipfs add` command.

Wider DAG trees (more links per node, higher fanout, larger thresholds) are beneficial for large files and directories with many files, reducing tree depth and lookup latency in high-latency networks, but they increase node size, straining memory and CPU on resource-constrained devices. Narrower trees (lower link count, lower fanout, smaller thresholds) are preferable for smaller directories, frequent updates, or low-power clients, minimizing overhead and ensuring compatibility, though they may increase traversal steps for very large datasets.

Kubo now allows users to act on these tradeoffs and customize the width of the DAG created by `ipfs add` command.

##### New `ipfs add` Options

Three new options allow you to override default settings for specific import operations:

- `--max-file-links`: Sets the maximum number of child links for a single file chunk.
- `--max-directory-links`: Defines the maximum number of child entries in a "basic" (single-chunk) directory.
  - Note: Directories exceeding this limit or the `Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectorySizeThreshold` are converted to HAMT-based (sharded across multiple blocks) structures.
- `--max-hamt-fanout`: Specifies the maximum number of child nodes for HAMT internal structures.

##### Persistent `Import.*` Configuration

You can set default values for these options using the following configuration settings:
- [`Import.UnixFSFileMaxLinks`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfsfilemaxlinks)
- [`Import.UnixFSDirectoryMaxLinks`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfsdirectorymaxlinks)
- [`Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectoryMaxFanout`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfshamtdirectorymaxfanout)
- [`Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectorySizeThreshold`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#importunixfshamtdirectorysizethreshold)

##### Updated Configuration Profiles

The release updated configuration [profiles](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#profiles) to incorporate these new `Import.*` settings:
- Updated Profile: `test-cid-v1` now includes current defaults as explicit `Import.UnixFSFileMaxLinks=174`, `Import.UnixFSDirectoryMaxLinks=0`, `Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectoryMaxFanout=256` and `Import.UnixFSHAMTDirectorySizeThreshold=256KiB`
- New Profile: `test-cid-v1-wide` adopts experimental directory DAG-shaping defaults, increasing the maximum file DAG width from 174 to 1024, HAMT fanout from 256 to 1024, and raising the HAMT directory sharding threshold from 256KiB to 1MiB, aligning with 1MiB file chunks.
  - Feedback: Try it out and share your thoughts at [discuss.ipfs.tech/t/should-we-profile-cids](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/should-we-profile-cids/18507) or [ipfs/specs#499](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/499).

> [!TIP]
> Apply one of CIDv1 test [profiles](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#profiles) with `ipfs config profile apply test-cid-v1[-wide]`.
