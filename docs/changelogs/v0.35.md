### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

##### `Routing.IgnoreProviders`

This new option allows ignoring specific peer IDs when returned by the content
routing system as providers of content. See the
[documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingignoreproviders)
for for information.

##### New DAG-shaping options when adding

We now allow controlling the default maximum number of links when adding content and building DAGs.

There are also three new `ipfs add` options that allow overiding the default only for specific import operation:

  - `--max-file-links`: controls the maximum number of children that a file node (when files are chunked, nodes have links to all the chunks).
  - `--max-directory-links`: controls the maximum number of children that a directory can have. Directories will be converted to HAMT-based directories when they have more than the given numbers of children.
  - `--max-hamt-fanout`: controls the maximum number of children that HAMT internal nodes can have.

Default options can be set permanently using the [corresponding `Import` settings](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#import):
- [`Import.UnixFSFileMaxLinks`](#TODO)
- [`Import.UnixFSirectoryMaxLinks`](#TODO)
- [`Import.UnixFSHAMTFanout`](#TODO)
- [`Import.UnixFSThreshold`](#TODO-move-from-Internal)

Convenience profiles were updated:
- Renamed `test-cid-v1` to `legacy-cid-v1`: this profile hardcodes the current defaults. useful for users who don't want implicit defaults to change in future Kubo releases
- Added `test-cid-v1-2025q2` with modern defaults (max file DAG width raised from 174 to 1024), these are candidates for new defaults in future Kubo release
