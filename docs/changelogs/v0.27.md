### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Gateway: support for `/api/v0` is deprecated

Support for exposing the legacy subset of Kubo RPC via the Gateway port is deprecated and should not be used. It will be removed in the next version. You can read more in <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/10312>.

If you have a legacy software that relies on this behavior, and want to expose parts of `/api/v0` next to `/ipfs`, use reverse-proxy in front of Kubo to mount both Gateway and RPC on the same port. NOTE: exposing RPC to the internet comes with security risk: make sure to specify access control via [API.Authorizations](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#apiauthorizations).

#### IPNS resolver cache's TTL can now be configured

You can now configure the upper-bound of a cached IPNS entry's Time-To-Live via [`Ipns.MaxCacheTTL`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#ipnsmaxcachettl).

#### RPC client: deprecated DHT API, added Routing API

The RPC client for GO (`kubo/client/rpc`) now includes a Routing API to match the available commands in `/api/v0/routing`. In addition, the DHT API has been marked as deprecated.

In the next version, all DHT deprecated methods will be removed from the Go RPC client.

#### Deprecated DHT commands removed from `/api/v0/dht`

All the DHT commands that were deprecated for over a year were finally removed from `/api/v0/dht`. Users should switch to modern `/api/v0/routing` which works with [both Amino DHT and Delegated Routers](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routing).
