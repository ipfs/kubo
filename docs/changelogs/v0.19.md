### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Improving the libp2p resource management integration
There are further followups up on libp2p resource manager improvements in Kubo [0.18.0](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.18.md#improving-libp2p-resource-management-integration-1)
and [0.18.1](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.18.md#improving-libp2p-resource-management-integration):
1. `ipfs swarm limits` and `ipfs swarm stats` have been replaced by `ipfs swarm resources` to provide a single/combined view for limits and their current usage in a more intuitive ordering.  
1. Removal of `Swarm.ResourceMgr.Limits` config.  Instead [the power user can specify limits in a .json file that are fed directly to go-libp2p](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md#user-supplied-override-limits).  This allows the power user to take advantage of the [new resource manager types introduced in go-libp2p 0.25](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#new-resource-manager-types-) including "use default", "unlimited", "block all".
   - Note: we don't expect most users to need these capablities, but they are there if so.
1. [Doc updates](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md).
