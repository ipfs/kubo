### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🧹 Automatic cleanup of interrupted imports

If you cancel `ipfs add` or `ipfs dag import` mid-operation, Kubo now automatically cleans up incomplete data on the next daemon start. Previously, interrupted imports would leave orphan blocks in your repository that were difficult to identify and remove without pins and running explicit garbage collection.

Batch operations also use less memory now. Block data is written to disk immediately rather than held in RAM until the batch commits.

Under the hood, the block storage layer (flatfs) was rewritten to use atomic batch operations via a temporary staging directory. See [go-ds-flatfs#142](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-flatfs/pull/142) for details.

#### Routing V1 HTTP API now exposed by default

The [Routing V1 HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is now exposed by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/routing/v1`. This allows light clients in browsers to use Kubo Gateway as a delegated routing backend instead of running a full DHT client. Support for [IPIP-476: Delegated Routing DHT Closest Peers API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476) is included. Can be disabled via [`Gateway.ExposeRoutingAPI`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewayexposeroutingapi).

#### Track total size when adding pins

Adds total size progress tracking of pinned nodes during `ipfs pin add --progress`. The output now shows the total size of the pinned dag.

Example output:

```
Fetched/Processed 336 nodes (83 MB)
```

#### Improved IPNS over PubSub validation

[IPNS over PubSub](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipns/ipns-pubsub-router/) implementation in Kubo is now more reliable. Duplicate messages are rejected even in large networks where messages may cycle back after the in-memory cache expires.

Kubo now persists the maximum seen sequence number per peer to the datastore ([go-libp2p-pubsub#BasicSeqnoValidator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub#BasicSeqnoValidator)), providing stronger duplicate detection that survives node restarts. This addresses message flooding issues reported in [#9665](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9665).

Kubo's pubsub is optimized for IPNS use case. For custom pubsub applications requiring different validation logic, use [go-libp2p-pubsub](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub) directly in a dedicated binary.

#### New `ipfs diag datastore` commands

New experimental commands for low-level datastore inspection:

- `ipfs diag datastore get <key>` - Read raw value at a datastore key (use `--hex` for hex dump)
- `ipfs diag datastore count <prefix>` - Count entries matching a datastore prefix

The daemon must not be running when using these commands. Run `ipfs diag datastore --help` for usage examples.

#### 🚇 Improved `ipfs p2p` tunnels with foreground mode

P2P tunnels can now run like SSH port forwarding: start a tunnel, use it, and it cleans up automatically when you're done.

The new `--foreground` (`-f`) flag for `ipfs p2p listen` and `ipfs p2p forward` keeps the command running until interrupted. When you Ctrl+C, send SIGTERM, or stop the service, the tunnel is removed automatically:

```console
$ ipfs p2p listen /x/ssh /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/22 --foreground
Listening on /x/ssh, forwarding to /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/22, waiting for interrupt...
^C
Received interrupt, removing listener for /x/ssh
```

Without `--foreground`, commands return immediately and tunnels persist until explicitly closed (existing behavior).

See [docs/p2p-tunnels.md](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/p2p-tunnels.md) for usage examples.

#### Improved `ipfs dag stat` output

The `ipfs dag stat` command has been improved for better terminal UX:

- Progress output now uses a single line with carriage return, avoiding terminal flooding
- Progress is auto-detected: shown only in interactive terminals by default
- Human-readable sizes are now displayed alongside raw byte counts

Example progress (interactive terminal):
```
Fetched/Processed 84 blocks, 2097152 bytes (2.1 MB)
```

Example summary output:
```
Summary
Total Size: 2097152 (2.1 MB)
Unique Blocks: 42
Shared Size: 1048576 (1.0 MB)
Ratio: 1.500000
```

Use `--progress=true` to force progress even when piped, or `--progress=false` to disable it.

#### Skip bad keys when listing

Change the `ipfs key list` behavior to log an error and continue listing keys when a key cannot be read from the keystore or decoded.

#### Accelerated DHT Client and Provide Sweep now work together

Previously, provide operations could start before the Accelerated DHT Client discovered enough peers, causing sweep mode to lose its efficiency benefits. Now, providing waits for the initial network crawl (about 10 minutes). Your content will be properly distributed across DHT regions after initial DHT map is created. Check `ipfs provide stat` to see when providing begins.

#### ⏱️ Configurable gateway request duration limit

[`Gateway.MaxRequestDuration`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaymaxrequestduration) sets an absolute deadline for gateway requests. Unlike `RetrievalTimeout` (which resets on each data write and catches stalled transfers), this is a hard limit on the total time a request can take.

The default 1 hour limit (previously hardcoded) can now be adjusted to fit your deployment needs. This is a fallback that prevents requests from hanging indefinitely when subsystem timeouts are misconfigured or fail to trigger. Returns 504 Gateway Timeout when exceeded.

#### 🔧 Recovery from corrupted MFS root

If your daemon fails to start because the MFS root is not a directory (due to misconfiguration, operational error, or disk corruption), you can now recover without deleting and recreating your repository in a new `IPFS_PATH`.

The new `ipfs files chroot` command lets you reset the MFS (Mutable File System) root or restore it to a known valid CID:

```console
# Reset MFS to an empty directory
$ ipfs files chroot --confirm

# Or restore from a previously saved directory CID
$ ipfs files chroot --confirm QmYourBackupCID
```

See `ipfs files chroot --help` for details.

#### 📋 Long listing format for `ipfs ls`

The `ipfs ls` command now supports `--long` (`-l`) flag for displaying Unix-style file permissions and modification times. This works with files added using `--preserve-mode` and `--preserve-mtime`. See `ipfs ls --help` for format details and examples.
