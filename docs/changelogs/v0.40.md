### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Routing V1 HTTP API now exposed by default

The [Routing V1 HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is now exposed by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/routing/v1`. This allows light clients in browsers to use Kubo Gateway as a delegated routing backend instead of running a full DHT client. Support for [IPIP-476: Delegated Routing DHT Closest Peers API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476) is included. Can be disabled via [`Gateway.ExposeRoutingAPI`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewayexposeroutingapi).

#### Track total size when adding pins

Adds total size progress tracking of pinned nodes during `ipfs pin add --progress`. The output now shows the total size of the pinned dag.

Example output:

```
Fetched/Processed 336 nodes (83 MB)
```

#### 🚇 Improved `ipfs p2p` tunnels with foreground mode

P2P tunnels can now run like SSH port forwarding: start a tunnel, use it, and it cleans up automatically when you're done.

The new `--foreground` (`-f`) flag for `ipfs p2p listen` and `ipfs p2p forward` keeps the command running until interrupted. When you Ctrl+C, send SIGTERM, or stop the service, the tunnel is removed automatically:

```console
$ ipfs p2p listen /x/ssh /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/22 --foreground
Listening on /x/ssh, forwarding to /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/22, waiting for interrupt...
^C
Received interrupt, removing listener for /x/ssh
```

Without `--foreground`, commands return immediately and tunnels persist until explicitly closed (existing behavior).

See [docs/p2p-tunnels.md](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/p2p-tunnels.md) for usage examples.

#### Improved `ipfs dag stat` output

The `ipfs dag stat` command has been improved for better terminal UX:

- Progress output now uses a single line with carriage return, avoiding terminal flooding
- Progress is auto-detected: shown only in interactive terminals by default
- Human-readable sizes are now displayed alongside raw byte counts

Example progress (interactive terminal):
```
Fetched/Processed 84 blocks, 2097152 bytes (2.1 MB)
```

Example summary output:
```
Summary
Total Size: 2097152 (2.1 MB)
Unique Blocks: 42
Shared Size: 1048576 (1.0 MB)
Ratio: 1.500000
```

Use `--progress=true` to force progress even when piped, or `--progress=false` to disable it.

#### Skip bad keys when listing

Change the `ipfs key list` behavior to log an error and continue listing keys when a key cannot be read from the keystore or decoded.

#### Gracefully skip socket files on add

`ipfs add` previously failed with a misleading "use of closed network connection" error when encountering socket files. It now gracefully skips them.

#### Accelerated DHT Client and Provide Sweep now work together

Previously, provide operations could start before the Accelerated DHT Client discovered enough peers, causing sweep mode to lose its efficiency benefits. Now, providing waits for the initial network crawl (about 10 minutes). Your content will be properly distributed across DHT regions after initial DHT map is created. Check `ipfs provide stat` to see when providing begins.

#### 📦️ Dependency updates
