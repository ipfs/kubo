### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Atomic batch writes in flatfs datastore

The flatfs datastore batch implementation has been rewritten to use atomic operations. Blocks are now written to a temporary directory first and renamed to their final locations only on commit.

If kubo is interrupted during `ipfs add` or `ipfs dag import`, uncommitted blocks are automatically cleaned up on the next start, preventing orphan blocks from polluting the datastore. Previously, interrupted imports could leave partial data behind that was difficult to identify and clean up.

This also reduces memory usage during batch operations, as blocks are written to disk asynchronously instead of being buffered in RAM.

See [go-ds-flatfs#142](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-flatfs/pull/142) for implementation details.

#### Routing V1 HTTP API now exposed by default

The [Routing V1 HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is now exposed by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/routing/v1`. This allows light clients in browsers to use Kubo Gateway as a delegated routing backend instead of running a full DHT client. Support for [IPIP-476: Delegated Routing DHT Closest Peers API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476) is included. Can be disabled via [`Gateway.ExposeRoutingAPI`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewayexposeroutingapi).

#### Track total size when adding pins

Adds total size progress tracking of pinned nodes during `ipfs pin add --progress`. The output now shows the total size of the pinned dag.

Example output:
```
Fetched/Processed 336 nodes (83 MB)
```
