### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Routing V1 HTTP API now exposed by default

The [Routing V1 HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is now exposed by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/routing/v1`. This allows light clients in browsers to use Kubo Gateway as a delegated routing backend instead of running a full DHT client. Support for [IPIP-476: Delegated Routing DHT Closest Peers API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476) is included. Can be disabled via [`Gateway.ExposeRoutingAPI`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewayexposeroutingapi).

#### Track total size when adding pins

Adds total size progress tracking of pinned nodes during `ipfs pin add --progress`. The output now shows the total size of the pinned dag.

Example output:
```
Fetched/Processed 336 nodes (83 MB)
```

#### Improved `ipfs dag stat` output

The `ipfs dag stat` command has been improved for better terminal UX:

- Progress output now uses a single line with carriage return, avoiding terminal flooding
- Progress is auto-detected: shown only in interactive terminals by default
- Human-readable sizes are now displayed alongside raw byte counts

Example progress (interactive terminal):
```
Fetched/Processed 84 blocks, 2097152 bytes (2.1 MB)
```

Example summary output:
```
Summary
Total Size: 2097152 (2.1 MB)
Unique Blocks: 42
Shared Size: 1048576 (1.0 MB)
Ratio: 1.500000
```

Use `--progress=true` to force progress even when piped, or `--progress=false` to disable it.
