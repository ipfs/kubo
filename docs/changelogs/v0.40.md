### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Routing V1 HTTP API now exposed by default

The [Routing V1 HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is now exposed by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/routing/v1`. This allows light clients in browsers to use Kubo Gateway as a delegated routing backend instead of running a full DHT client. Support for [IPIP-476: Delegated Routing DHT Closest Peers API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476) is included. Can be disabled via [`Gateway.ExposeRoutingAPI`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewayexposeroutingapi).

#### Track total size when adding pins

Adds total size progress tracking of pinned nodes during `ipfs pin add --progress`. The output now shows the total size of the pinned dag.

Example output:
```
Fetched/Processed 336 nodes (83 MB)
```

#### Fixed `ipfs dag stat` block counting

Since Kubo v0.12.0, blocks are stored by multihash, so the same data is stored only once regardless of which CID references it. The `dag stat` command now reflects actual storage by deduplicating blocks by content hash (e.g., data referenced via both CIDv0 and CIDv1 is counted once). See `ipfs dag stat --help` for more details.
