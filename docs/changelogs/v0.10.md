# go-ipfs changelog v0.10

## v0.10.0 2021-09-30

We're happy to announce go-ipfs 0.10.0. This release brings some big changes to the IPLD internals of go-ipfs that make working with non-UnixFS DAGs easier than ever. There are also a variety of new commands and configuration options available.

As usual, this release includes important fixes, some of which may be critical for security. Unless the fix addresses a bug being exploited in the wild, the fix will _not_ be called out in the release notes. Please make sure to update ASAP. See our [release process](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/docs/releases.md#security-fix-policy) for details.

### 🛠 TLDR: BREAKING CHANGES

- `ipfs dag get`
  - default output changed to [`dag-json`](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/)
  - dag-pb (e.g. unixfs) field names changed - impacts userland code that works with `dag-pb` objects returned by `dag get`
  - no longer emits an additional new-line character at the end of the data output
- `ipfs dag put`
  - defaults changed to reduce ambiguity and surprises: input is now assumed to be [`dag-json`](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/), and data is serialized to [`dag-cbor`](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/spec/) at rest.
  - `--format` and `--input-enc` were removed and replaced with `--store-codec` and `--input-codec`
  - codec names now match the ones defined in the [multicodec table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv)
  - dag-pb (e.g. unixfs) field names changed - impacts userland code that works with `dag-pb` objects stored via `dag put`

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🌲 IPLD Levels Up

The handling of data serialization as well as many aspects of DAG traversal and pathing have been migrated from older libraries, including [go-merkledag](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag) and [go-ipld-format](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format) to the new **[go-ipld-prime](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime)** library and its components. This allows us to use many of the newer tools afforded by go-ipld-prime, stricter and more uniform codec implementations, support for additional (pluggable) codecs, and some minor performance improvements.

This is significant refactor of a core component that touches many parts of IPFS, and does come with some **breaking changes**:

* **IPLD plugins**:
  * The `PluginIPLD` interface has been changed to utilize go-ipld-prime. There is a demonstration of the change in the [bundled git plugin](./plugin/plugins/git/).
* **The semantics of `dag put` and `dag get` change**:
  * `dag get` now takes the `output-codec` option which accepts a [multicodec](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#multicodec) name used to encode the output. By default this is `dag-json`, which is  a strict and deterministic subset of JSON created by the IPLD team. Users may notice differences from the previously plain Go JSON output, particularly where bytes are concerned which are now encoded using a form similar to CIDs: `{"/":{"bytes":"unpadded-base64-bytes"}}` rather than the previously Go-specific plain padded base64 string. See the [dag-json specification](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/) for an explanation of these forms.
  * `dag get` no longer prints an additional new-line character at the end of the encoded block output. This means that the output as presented by `dag get` are the exact bytes of the requested node. A round-trip of such bytes back in through `dag put` using the same codec should result in the same CID.
  * `dag put` uses the `input-codec` option to specify the multicodec name of the format data is being provided in, and the `store-codec` option to specify the multicodec name of the format the data should be stored in at rest. These formerly defaulted to `json` and `cbor` respectively. They now default to `dag-json` and `dag-cbor` respectively but may be changed to any supported codec (bundled or loaded via plugin) by its [multicodec name](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv).
  * The `json` and `cbor` multicodec names (as used by `input-enc` and `format` options) are now no longer aliases for `dag-json` and `dag-cbor` respectively. Instead, they now refer to their proper [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv) types. `cbor` refers to a plain CBOR format, which will not encode CIDs and does not have strict deterministic encoding rules. `json` is a plain JSON format, which also won't encode CIDs and will encode bytes in the Go-specific padded base64 string format rather than the dag-json method of byte encoding. See https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/ for more information on IPLD codecs.
  * `protobuf` is no longer used as the codec name for `dag-pb`
  * The codec name `raw` is used to mean Bytes in the [IPLD Data Model](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/data-model-layer/data-model.md#bytes-kind)
* **UnixFS refactor**. The **dag-pb codec**, which is used to encode UnixFS data for IPFS, is now represented through the `dag` API in a form that mirrors the protobuf schema used to define the binary format. This unifies the implementations and specification of dag-pb across the IPLD and IPFS stacks. Previously, additional layers of code for file and directory handling within IPFS between protobuf serialization and UnixFS obscured the protobuf representation. Much of this code has now been replaced and there are fewer layers of transformation. This means that interacting with dag-pb data via the `dag` API will use different forms:
  * Previously, using `dag get` on a dag-pb block would present the block serialized as JSON as `{"data":"padded-base64-bytes","links":[{"Name":"foo","Size":100,"Cid":{"/":"Qm..."}},...]}`.
  * Now,  the dag-pb data with dag-json codec for output will be serialized using the data model from the [dag-pb specification](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-pb/spec/): `{"Data":{"/":{"bytes":"unpadded-base64-bytes"}},"Links":[{"Name":"foo","Tsize":100,"Hash":{"/":"Qm..."}},...]}`. Aside from the change in byte formatting, most field names have changed: `data` → `Data`, `links` → `Links`, `Size` → `Tsize`, `Cid` → `Hash`. Note that this output can be changed now using the `output-codec` option to specify an alternative codec.
  * Similarly, using `dag put` and a `store-codec` option of `dag-pb` now requires that the input conform to this dag-pb specified form. Previously, input using `{"data":"...","links":[...]}` was accepted, now it must be `{"Data":"...","Links":[...]}`.
  * Previously it was not possible to use paths to navigate to any of these properties of a dag-pb node, the only possible paths were named links, e.g. `dag get QmFoo/NamedLink` where `NamedLink` was one of the links whose name was `NamedLink`. This functionality remains the same, but by prefixing the path with `/ipld/` we enter data model pathing semantics and can `dag get /ipld/QmFoo/Links/0/Hash` to navigate to links or `/ipld/QmFoo/Data` to simply retrieve the data section of the node, for example.
  * ℹ See the [dag-pb specification](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-pb/) for details on the codec and its data model representation.
  * ℹ See this [detailed write-up](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/design/tricky-choices/dag-pb-forms-impl-and-use.md) for further background on these changes.

#### Ⓜ Multibase Command

go-ipfs now provides utility commands for working with [multibase](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#multibase):

```console
$ echo -n hello | ipfs multibase encode -b base16 > file-mbase16
$ cat file-mbase16
f68656c6c6f

$ ipfs multibase decode file-mbase16
hello

$ cat file-mbase16 | ipfs multibase decode
hello

$ ipfs multibase transcode -b base2 file-mbase16
00110100001100101011011000110110001101111
```

See `ipfs multibase --help` for more examples.

#### 🔨 Bitswap now supports greater configurability

This release adds an [`Internal` section](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#internal) to the configuration file that is designed to help advanced users optimize their setups without needing a custom binary. The `Internal` section is not guaranteed to be the same from release to release and may not be covered by migrations. If you use the `Internal` section you should be making sure to check the config documentation between releases for any changes.

#### 🐚 Programmatic shell completions command

`ipfs commands completion bash` will generate a bash completion script for go-ipfs commands

#### 📜 Profile collection command

Performance profiles can now be collected using `ipfs diag profile`. If you need to do some debugging or have an issue to submit the collected profiles are very useful to have around.

#### 🍎 Mac OS notarized binaries

The go-ipfs and related migration binaries (for both Intel and Apple Sillicon) are now signed and notarized to make Mac OS installation easier.

#### 👨‍👩‍👦 Improved MDNS

There is a completed implementation of the revised libp2p MDNS spec. This should result in better MDNS discovery and better local/offline operation as a result.

#### 🚗 CAR import statistics

`dag import` command now  supports `--stats` option which will include the number of imported blocks and their total size in the output.

#### 🕸 Peering command

This release adds `swarm peering`  command for easy management of  the peering subsystem. Peer in the peering subsystem is maintained to be connected at all times, and gets reconnected on disconnect with a back-off.

See `ipfs swarm peering --help` for more details.
