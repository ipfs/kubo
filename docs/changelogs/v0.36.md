### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### HTTP Retrieval client enabled by default

This release promotes the HTTP Retrieval client from an experimental feature to a standard feature that is enabled by default. When possible, Kubo will be retrieving blocks over plain HTTPS (HTTP/2) without any extra user configuration.

See [`HTTPRetrieval`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#httpretrieval) for more details.

#### Update go-log to v2

go-log v2 has been out for quite a while now and it is time to deprecate v1. 

- Replace all use of `go-log` with `go-log/v2`
- Makes `/api/v0/log/tail` useful over HTTP
- Fixes `ipfs log tail`
- Removes support for `ContextWithLoggable` as this is not needed for tracing-like functionality

#### AutoNATv2 Client

This Kubo release starts utilizing [AutoNATv2](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) client functionality. go-libp2p v0.42 supports and depends on both AutoNATv1 and v2, and Autorelay feature continues to use v1. go-libp2p v0.43+ will discontinue internal use of AutoNATv1. We will maintain support for both v1 and v2 until then, though v1 will gradually be deprecated and ultimately removed.

##### Smarter AutoTLS registration

This update to libp2p and [AutoTLS](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autotls) tests AutoNATv2 changes. It aims to reduce false-positive scenarios where AutoTLS certificate registration occurred before a publicly dialable multiaddr was available. This should result in fewer error logs during node start, especially when IPv6 and/or IPv4 NATs with UPnP/PCP/NAT-PMP are at play.

#### Overwrite option for files cp command

The `ipfs files cp` command has a `--force` option to allow it to overwrite existing files. Attempting to overwrite an existing directory results in an error.

#### Option for filestore command to remove bad blocks

The `filestore` command has a new option, `--remove-bad-blocks`, to verify objects in the filestore and remove those that fail verification.

#### 📦️ Important dependency updates
