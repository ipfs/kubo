### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Support for content blocking

This Kubo release ships with built-in content-blocking subsystem [announced earlier this year](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-content-blocking-for-the-ipfs-stack/).
Content blocking is an opt-in decision made by the operator of `ipfs daemon`.
The official build does not ship with any denylists.

#### Gateway: the root of the CARs are no longer meaningful

When requesting a CAR from the gateway, the root of the CAR might no longer be
meaningful. By default, the CAR root will be the last resolvable segment of the
path. However, in situations where the path cannot be resolved, such as when
the path does not exist, a CAR will be sent with a root of `bafkqaaa` (empty CID).
This CAR will contain all blocks necessary to validate that the path does not exist.
