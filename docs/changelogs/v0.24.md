### Overview

### üî¶ Highlights

#### Support for content blocking

This Kubo release ships with built-in content-blocking subsystem [announced earlier this year](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-content-blocking-for-the-ipfs-stack/).
Content blocking is an opt-in decision made by the operator of `ipfs daemon`.
The official build does not ship with any denylists.

Learn more at [`/docs/content-blocking.md`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/content-blocking.md)

#### Gateway: the root of the CARs are no longer meaningful

When requesting a CAR from the gateway, the root of the CAR might no longer be
meaningful. By default, the CAR root will be the last resolvable segment of the
path. However, in situations where the path cannot be resolved, such as when
the path does not exist, a CAR will be sent with a root of `bafkqaaa` (empty CID).
This CAR will contain all blocks necessary to validate that the path does not exist.

#### IPNS: improved publishing defaults

This release changes the default values used when publishing IPNS record
via `ipfs name publish` command:

- Default `--lifetime` increased from `24h` to `48h` to take full advantage of
  the increased expiration window of Amino DHT
  ([go-libp2p-kad-dht#793](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/793))
- Default `--ttl` increased from `1m` to `1h` to improve website caching and follow
  saner defaults present in similar systems like DNS
  ([specs#371](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/371))

This change only impacts the implicit defaults, when mentioned parameters are omitted
during publishing. Users are free to override the default if different value
makes more sense for their use case.

#### IPNS: record TTL is used for caching

In this release, we've made significant improvements to IPNS caching.

Previously, the TTL value in IPNS records was not utilized, and the
`boxo/namesys` library maintained a static one-minute resolution cache.

With this update, IPNS publishers gain more control over how long a valid IPNS
record remains cached before checking an upstream routing system, such as Amino
DHT, for updates. The TTL value in the IPNS record now serves as a hint for:

- `boxo/namesys`: the internal cache, determining how long the IPNS resolution
  result is cached before asking upsteam routing systems for updates.
- `boxo/gateway`: the `Cache-Control` HTTP header in responses to requests made
  for `/ipns/name` content paths.

These changes make it easier for rarely updated IPNS-hosted websites to be
cached more efficiently and load faster in browser contexts.

#### Experimental Transport: WebRTC Direct

This Kubo release includes the initial work towards WebRTC Direct
introduced in [`go-libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.32.0) v0.32:

> [WebRTC Direct](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/webrtc/webrtc-direct.md)
> allows browser nodes to connect to go-libp2p nodes directly,
> without any configuration (e.g. TLS certificates) needed on the go-libp2p
> side. This is useful for browser nodes that aren‚Äôt able to use
> [WebTransport](https://blog.libp2p.io/2022-12-19-libp2p-webtransport/).

The `/webrtc-direct` transport is disabled by default in Kubo 0.24,
and not ready for production use yet, but we plan to enable it in a future release.

See [`Swarm.Transports.Network.WebRTCDirect`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmtransportsnetworkwebrtcdirect)
to learn how to enable it manually, and what current limitations are.
