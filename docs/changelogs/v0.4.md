# go-ipfs changelog v0.4

## v0.4.23 2020-01-29

Given the large number of fixes merged since 0.4.22, we've decided to cut another patch release.

This release contains critical fixes. Please upgrade ASAP. Importantly, we're strongly considering switching to TLS by default in go-ipfs 0.5.0 and dropping SECIO support. However, the current TLS transport in go-ipfs 0.4.22 has a bug that can cause connections to spontaneously disconnect during the handshake.

This release fixes that bug, among many other issues. Users that _don't_ upgrade may experience connectivity issues when the network upgrades to go-ipfs 0.5.0.

### Highlights

* Fixes build on go 1.13
* Fixes an issue where we may not connect to providers in bitswap.
* Fixes an issue on the TLS transport where we may abort a handshake unintentionally.
* Fixes a common panic in the websocket transport.
* Adds support for recursively resolving dnsaddrs (makes go-ipfs compatible with the new bootstrappers).
* Fixes several potential panics/crashes.
* Switches to using pre-defined autorelays instead of trying to find them in the DHT:
  * Avoids selecting random, potentially poor, relays.
  * Avoids spamming the DHT with requests trying to find relays.
  * Reduces the impact of accidentally enabling AutoRelay + RelayHop. I.e., the network won't try to DoS you.
* Modifies the connection manager to not count connections in the grace period towards the connection limit.
  * Pro: New connections don't cause us to close useful, existing connections.
  * Con: Libp2p will keep more connections. Consider reducing your HighWater after applying this patch.
* Improved peer usefulness tracking in bitswap. Frequently used peers will be marked as "important" and the connection manager will avoid closing connections to these peers.
* Includes a new version of the WebUI to fix some issues with the peers map.

## v0.4.22 2019-08-06

We're releasing a PATCH release of go-ipfs based on 0.4.21 containing some critical fixes.

The IPFS network has scaled to the point where small changes can have a
wide-reaching impact on the entire network. To keep this situation from
escalating, we've put a hold on releasing new features until we can improve our
[release process](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/releases.md)
(which we've trialed in this release) and [testing
procedures](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6483).

This release includes fixes for the following regressions:

1. A major bitswap throughput regression introduced in 0.4.21
   ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6442](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6442)).
2. High bitswap CPU usage when connected to many (e.g. 10,000) peers. See
   [ipfs/go-bitswap#154](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/154).
2. The local network discovery service sometimes initializes before the
   networking module, causing it to announce the wrong addresses and sometimes
   complain about not being able to determine the IP address
   ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6415](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6415)).

It also includes fixes for:

1. Pins not being persisted after `ipfs block add --pin`
   ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6441](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6441)).
2. Panic due to concurrent map access when adding and listing pins at the same
   time ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6419](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6419)).
3. Potential pin-set corruption given a concurrent `ipfs repo gc` and `ipfs pin
   rm` ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6444](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6444)).
4. Build failure due to a deleted git tag in one of our dependencies
   ([ipfs/go-ds-badger#64](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-badger/pull/65)).

Thanks to:

* [@hannahhoward](https://github.com/hannahhoward) for fixing both bitswap issues.
* [@sanderpick](https://github.com/sanderpick) for catching and fixing the local
  discovery bug.
* [@campoy](https://github.com/campoy) for fixing the build issue.

## v0.4.21 2019-05-30

We're happy to announce go-ipfs 0.4.21. This release has some critical bug fixes
and a handful of new features so every user should upgrade.

Key bug fixes:

* Too many open file descriptors/too many peers
  ([#6237](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6237)).
* Adding multiple files at the same time doesn't work
  ([#6254](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6255)).
* CPU utilization spikes and then holds at 100%
  ([#5613](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5613)).

Key features:

* Experimental TLS1.3 support (to eventually replace secio).
* OpenSSL support for SECIO handshakes (performance improvement).

**IMPORTANT:** This release fixes a bug in our security transport that could
potentially drop data from the channel. Note: This issue affects neither the
privacy nor the integrity of the data with respect to a third-party attacker.
Only the peer sending us data could trigger this bug.

**ALL USERS MUST UPGRADE.** We intended to introduce a feature this release that,
unfortunately, [reliably triggered this bug][secio-bug]. To avoid partitioning
the network, we've decided to postpone this feature for a release or two.

Specifically, we're going to provide a minimum _one month_ upgrade period. After
that, we'll start testing the impact of deploying the proposed changes.

If you're running the mainline go-ipfs, please upgrade ASAP. If you're building
a separate app or working on a forked go-ipfs, make sure to upgrade
github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-secio to _at least_ v0.0.3.

### Bug Fixes And Enhancements

This release includes quite a number of critical bug fixes and
performance/reliability enhancements.

#### Error when adding multiple files

The last release broke the simple command `ipfs add file1 file2`. It turns out
we simply lacked a test case for this. Both of these issues (the bug and the
lack of a test case) have now been fixed.

#### SECIO

As noted above, we've fixed a bug that could cause data to be dropped from a
SECIO connection on read. Specifically, this happens when:

1. The capacity of the read buffer is greater than the length.
2. The remote peer sent more than the length but less than the capacity in a
   single secio "frame".

In this case, we'd fill the read buffer to it's capacity instead of its length.

#### Too many open files, too many peers, etc.

Go-ipfs automatically closes the least useful connections when it accumulates
too many connections. Unfortunately, some relayed connections were blocking in
`Close()`, halting the entire process.

#### Out of control CPU usage

Many users noted out of control CPU usage this release. This turned out to be a
long-standing issue with how the DHT handled provider records (records recording
which peers have what content):

1. It wasn't removing provider records for content until the set of providers
   completely emptied.
2. It was loading every provider record into memory whenever we updated the set
   of providers.

Combined, these two issues were trashing the provider record cache, forcing the
DHT to repeatedly load and discard provider records.

#### More Reliable Connection Management

Go-ipfs has a subsystem called the "connection manager" to close the
least-useful connections when go-ipfs runs low on resources.

Unfortunately, other IPFS subsystems may learn about connections _before_ the
connection manager. Previously, if some IPFS subsystem tried to mark a
connection as useful before the connection manager learned about it, the
connection manager would discard this information. We believe this was causing
[#6271](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6271). [It no longer does
that](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-connmgr/pull/39).

#### Improved Bitswap Connection Management

Bitswap now uses the connection manager to mark all peers downloading blocks as
important (while downloading). Previously, it only marked peers from which _it_
was downloading blocks.

#### Reduced Memory Usage

The most noticeable memory reduction in this release comes from fixing connection
closing. However, we've made a few additional improvements:

* Bitswap's "work queue" no longer remembers every peer it has seen
  indefinitely.
* The peerstore now interns protocol names.
* The per-peer goroutine count has been reduced.
* The DHT now wastes less memory on idle peers by pooling buffered writers and
  returning them to the pool when not actively using them.

#### Increased File Descriptor Limit

The default file descriptor limit has been raised to 8192 (from 2048).
Unfortunately, go-ipfs behaves poorly when it runs out of file descriptors and
it uses a _lot_ of file descriptors.

Luckily, most modern kernels can handle thousands of file descriptors without
any difficulty.

#### Decreased Connection Handshake Latency

Libp2p now shaves off a couple of round trips when initiating connections by
beginning the protocol negotiation before the remote peer responds to the
initial handshake message.

In the optimal case (when the target peer speaks our preferred protocol), this
reduces the number of handshake round-trips from 6 to 4 (including the TCP
handshake).

### Commands

This release brings no new commands but does introduce a few changes, bugfixes,
and enhancements. This section is hardly complete but it lists the most
noticeable changes.

Take note: this release also introduces a few breaking changes.

#### [DEPRECATION] The URLStore Command Deprecated

The experimental `ipfs urlstore` command is now deprecated. Please use `ipfs add
--nocopy URL` instead.

#### [BREAKING] The DHT Command Base64 Encodes Values

When responding to an `ipfs dht get` command, the daemon now encodes the
returned value using base64. The `ipfs` command will automatically decode this
value before returning it to the user so this change should only affect those
using the HTTP API directly.

Unfortunately, this change was necessary as DHT records are arbitrary binary
blobs which can't be directly stored in JSON strings.

#### [BREAKING] Base32 Encoded v1 CIDs By Default

Both js-ipfs and go-ipfs now encode CIDv1 CIDs using base32 by default, instead
of base58. Unfortunately, base58 is case-sensitive and doesn't play well with
browsers (see [#4143](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4143).

#### Human Readable Numbers

The `ipfs bitswap stat` and and `ipfs object stat` commands now support a
`--humanize` flag that formats numbers with human-readable units (GiB, MiB,
etc.).

#### Improved Errors

This release improves two types of errors:

1. Commands that take paths/multiaddrs now include the path/multiaddr in the
   error message when it fails to parse.
2. `ipfs swarm connect` now returns a detailed error describing which addresses
   were tried and why the dial failed.

#### Ping Improvements

The ping command has received some small improvements and fixes:

1. It now exits with a non-zero exit status on failure.
2. It no longer succeeds with zero successful pings if we have a zombie but
   non-functional connection to the peer being pinged
   ([#6298](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6298)).
3. It now prints out the average latency when canceled with `^C` (like the unix
   `ping` command).

#### Improved Help Text

Go-ipfs now intelligently wraps help text for easier reading. On an 80 character
wide terminal,

**Before**

### Features

This release is primarily a bug fix release but it still includes two nice
features from libp2p.

#### Experimental TLS1.3 support

Go-ipfs now has experimental TLS1.3 support. Currently, libp2p (IPFS's
networking library) uses a custom TLS-like protocol we call SECIO. However, the
conventional wisdom concerning custom security transports is "just don't" so we
are working on replacing it with TLS1.3

To choose this protocol by default, set the `Experimental.PreferTLS` config
variable:

```bash
> ipfs config --bool Experimental.PreferTLS true
```

Why TLS1.3 and not X (noise, etc.)?

1. Libp2p allows negotiating transports so there's no reason not to add noise
   support to libp2p as well.
2. TLS has wide language support which should make implementing libp2p for new
   languages significantly simpler.

#### OpenSSL Support

Go-ipfs can now (optionally) be built with OpenSSL support for improved
performance when establishing connections. This is primarily useful for nodes
receiving multiple inbound connections per second.

To enable openssl support, rebuild go-ipfs with:

```bash
> make build GOTAGS=openssl
```

### CoreAPI

The CoreAPI refactor is still underway and we've made significant progress
towards a usable ipfs-as-a-library constructor. Specifically, we've integrated
the [fx](https://go.uber.org/fx) dependency injection system and are
now working on cleaning up our initialization logic. This should make it easier
to inject new services into a go-ipfs process without messing with the core
internals.

### Build: `GOCC` Environment Variable

Build system now uses `GOCC` environment variable allowing for use of specific
go versions during builds.

## v0.4.20 2019-04-16

We're happy to release go-ipfs 0.4.20. This release includes some critical
performance and stability fixes so all users should upgrade ASAP.

This is also the first release to use go modules instead of GX. While GX has
been a great way to dogfood an IPFS-based package manager, building and
maintaining a custom package manager is a _lot_ of work and we haven't been able
to dedicate enough time to bring the user experience of gx to an acceptable
level. You can read [#5850](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5850) for
some discussion on this matter.

### Docker

As of this release, it's now much easier to run arbitrary IPFS commands within
the docker container:

```bash
> docker run --name my-ipfs ipfs/go-ipfs:v0.4.20 config profile apply server # apply the server profile
> docker start my-ipfs # start the daemon
```

This release also [reverts](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6040) a change that
caused some significant trouble in 0.4.19. If you've been running into Docker
permission errors in 0.4.19, please upgrade.

### WebUI

This release contains a major
[WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui) release with some
significant improvements to the file browser and new opt-in, privately hosted,
anonymous usage analytics.

### Commands

As usual, we've made several changes and improvements to our commands. The most
notable changes are listed in this section.

#### New: `ipfs version deps`

This release includes a new command, `ipfs version deps`, to list all
dependencies (with versions) of the current go-ipfs build. This should make it
easy to tell exactly how go-ipfs was built when tracking down issues.

#### New: `ipfs add URL`

The `ipfs add` command has gained support for URLs. This means you can:

1. Add files with `ipfs add URL` instead of downloading the file first.
2. Replace all uses of the `ipfs urlstore` command with a call to `ipfs add
   --nocopy`. The `ipfs urlstore` command will be deprecated in a future
   release.


#### Changed: `ipfs swarm connect`

The `ipfs swarm connect` command has a few new features:

It now marks the newly created connection as "important". This should ensure
that the connection manager won't come along later and close the connection if
it doesn't think it's being used.

It can now resolve `/dnsaddr` addresses that _don't_ end in a peer ID. For
example, you can now run `ipfs swarm connect /dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io` to
connect to one of the bootstrap peers at random. NOTE: This could connect you to
an _arbitrary_ peer as DNS is not secure (by default). Please do not rely on
this except for testing or unless you know what you're doing.

Finally, `ipfs swarm connect` now returns _all_ errors on failure. This should
make it much easier to debug connectivity issues. For example, one might see an
error like:

```
Error: connect QmYou failure: dial attempt failed: 6 errors occurred:
	* <peer.ID Qm*Me> --> <peer.ID Qm*You> (/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001) dial attempt failed: dial tcp4 127.0.0.1:4001: connect: connection refused
	* <peer.ID Qm*Me> --> <peer.ID Qm*You> (/ip6/::1/tcp/4001) dial attempt failed: dial tcp6 [::1]:4001: connect: connection refused
	* <peer.ID Qm*Me> --> <peer.ID Qm*You> (/ip6/2604::1/tcp/4001) dial attempt failed: dial tcp6 [2604::1]:4001: connect: network is unreachable
	* <peer.ID Qm*Me> --> <peer.ID Qm*You> (/ip6/2602::1/tcp/4001) dial attempt failed: dial tcp6 [2602::1]:4001: connect: network is unreachable
	* <peer.ID Qm*Me> --> <peer.ID Qm*You> (/ip4/150.0.1.2/tcp/4001) dial attempt failed: dial tcp4 0.0.0.0:4001->150.0.1.2:4001: i/o timeout
	* <peer.ID Qm*Me> --> <peer.ID Qm*You> (/ip4/200.0.1.2/tcp/4001) dial attempt failed: dial tcp4 0.0.0.0:4001->200.0.1.2:4001: i/o timeout
```

#### Changed: `ipfs bitswap stat`

`ipfs bitswap stat` no longer lists bitswap partners unless the `-v` flag is
passed. That is, it will now return:

```
> ipfs bitswap stat
bitswap status
	provides buffer: 0 / 256
	blocks received: 0
	blocks sent: 79
	data received: 0
	data sent: 672706
	dup blocks received: 0
	dup data received: 0 B
	wantlist [0 keys]
	partners [197]
```

Instead of:

```
> ipfs bitswap stat -v
bitswap status
	provides buffer: 0 / 256
	blocks received: 0
	blocks sent: 79
	data received: 0
	data sent: 672706
	dup blocks received: 0
	dup data received: 0 B
	wantlist [0 keys]
	partners [203]
		QmNQTTTRCDpCYCiiu6TYWCqEa7ShAUo9jrZJvWngfSu1mL
		QmNWaxbqERvdcgoWpqAhDMrbK2gKi3SMGk3LUEvfcqZcf4
		QmNgSVpgZVEd41pBX6DyCaHRof8UmUJLqQ3XH2qNL9xLvN
        ... omitting 200 lines ...
```

#### Changed: `ipfs repo stat --human`

The `--human` flag in the `ipfs repo stat` command now intelligently picks a
size unit instead of always using MiB.

#### Changed: `ipfs resolve` (`ipfs dns`, `ipfs name resolve`)

All of the resolve commands now:

1. Resolve _recursively_ (up to 32 steps) by default to better match user
   expectations (these commands used to be non-recursive by default). To turn
   recursion off, pass `-r false`.
2. When resolving non-recursively, these commands no longer fail when partially
   resolving a name. Instead, they simply return the intermediate result.

#### Changed: `ipfs files flush`

The `ipfs files flush` command now returns the CID of the flushed file.

### Performance And Reliability

This release has the usual collection of performance and reliability
improvements.

#### Badger Memory Usage

Those of you using the badger datastore should notice reduced memory usage in
this release due to some upstream changes. Badger still uses significantly more
memory than the default datastore configuration but this will hopefully continue
to improve.

#### Bitswap

We fixed some critical CPU utilization regressions in bitswap for this release.
If you've been noticing CPU _regressions_ in go-ipfs 0.4.19, especially when
running a public gateway, upgrading to 0.4.20 will likely fix them.

#### Relays

After AutoRelay was introduced in go-ipfs 0.4.19, the number of peers connecting
through relays skyrocketed to over 120K concurrent peers. This highlighted some
performance issues that we've now fixed in this release. Specifically:

* We've significantly reduced the amount of memory allocated per-peer.
* We've fixed a bug where relays might, in rare cases, try to actively dial a
  peer to relay traffic. By default, relays only forward traffic between peers
  already connected to the relay.
* We've fixed quite a number of performance issues that only show up when
  rapidly forming new connections. This will actually help _all_ nodes but will
  especially help relays.

If you've enabled relay _hop_ (`Swarm.EnableRelayHop`) in go-ipfs 0.4.19 and it
hasn't burned down your machine yet, this release should improve things
significantly. However, relays are still under heavy load so running an open
relay will continue to be resource intensive.

We're continuing to investigate this issue and have a few more patches on the
way that, unfortunately, won't make it into this release.

#### Panics

We've fixed two notable panics in this release:

* We've fixed a frequent panic in the DHT.
* We've fixed an occasional panic in the experimental QUIC transport.

### Content Routing

IPFS announces and finds content by sending and retrieving content routing
("provider") records to and from the DHT. Unfortunately, sending out these
records can be quite resource intensive.

This release has two changes to alleviate this: a reduced number of initial
provide workers and a persistent provider queue.

We've reduced the number of parallel initial provide workers (workers that send
out provider records when content is initially added to go-ipfs) from 512 to 6.
Each provide request (currently, due to some issues in our DHT) tries to
establish hundreds of connections, significantly impacting the performance of
go-ipfs and [crashing some
routers](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3320).

We've introduced a new persistent provider queue for files added via `ipfs add`
and `ipfs pin add`. When new directory trees are added to go-ipfs, go-ipfs will
add the root/final CID to this queue. Then, in the background, go-ipfs will walk
the queue, sequentially sending out provider records for each CID.

This ensures that root CIDs are sent out as soon as possible and are sent even
when files are added when the go-ipfs daemon isn't running.

By example, let's add a directory tree to go-ipfs:

```bash
> # We're going to do this in "online" mode first so let's start the daemon.
> ipfs daemon &
...
Daemon is ready
> # Now, we're going to create a directory to add.
> mkdir foo
> for i in {0..1000}; do echo do echo $i > foo/$i; done
> # finally, we're going to add it.
> ipfs add -r foo
added QmUQcSjQx2bg4cSe2rUZyQi6F8QtJFJb74fWL7D784UWf9 foo/0
...
added QmQac2chFyJ24yfG2Dfuqg1P5gipLcgUDuiuYkQ5ExwGap foo/990
added QmQWwz9haeQ5T2QmQeXzqspKdowzYELShBCLzLJjVa2DuV foo/991
added QmQ5D4MtHUN4LTS4n7mgyHyaUukieMMyCfvnzXQAAbgTJm foo/992
added QmZq4n4KRNq3k1ovzxJ4qdQXZSrarfJjnoLYPR3ztHd7EY foo/993
added QmdtrsuVf8Nf1s1MaSjLAd54iNqrn1KN9VoFNgKGnLgjbt foo/994
added QmbstvU9mnW2hsE94WFmw5WbrXdLTu2Sf9kWWSozrSDscL foo/995
added QmXFd7f35gAnmisjfFmfYKkjA3F3TSpvUYB9SXr6tLsdg8 foo/996
added QmV5BxS1YQ9V227Np2Cq124cRrFDAyBXNMqHHa6kpJ9cr6 foo/997
added QmcXsccUtwKeQ1SuYC3YgyFUeYmAR9CXwGGnT3LPeCg5Tx foo/998
added Qmc4mcQcpaNzyDQxQj5SyxwFg9ZYz5XBEeEZAuH4cQirj9 foo/999
added QmXpXzUhcS9edmFBuVafV5wFXKjfXkCQcjAUZsTs7qFf3G foo
```

In 0.4.19, we would have sent out provider records for files `foo/{0..1000}`
_before_ sending out a provider record for `foo`. If you were ask a friend to
download /ipfs/QmUQcSjQx2bg4cSe2rUZyQi6F8QtJFJb74fWL7D784UWf9, they would
(baring other issues) be able to find it pretty quickly as this is the first CID
you'll have announced to the network. However, if you ask your friend to
download /ipfs/QmXpXzUhcS9edmFBuVafV5wFXKjfXkCQcjAUZsTs7qFf3G/0, they'll have to
wait for you to finish telling the network about every file in `foo` first.

In 0.4.20, we _immediately_ tell the network about
`QmXpXzUhcS9edmFBuVafV5wFXKjfXkCQcjAUZsTs7qFf3G` (the `foo` directory) as soon
as we finish adding the directory to go-ipfs _without_ waiting to finish
announcing `foo/{0..1000}`. This is especially important in this release
because we've drastically reduced the number of provide workers.

The second benefit is that this queue is persistent. That means go-ipfs won't
forget to send out this record, even if it was offline when the content was
initially added. NOTE: go-ipfs _does_ continuously _re_-send provider records in
the background twice a day, it just might be a while before it gets around to
sending one out any specific one.

### Bitswap

Bitswap now periodically re-sends its wantlist to connected peers. This should
help work around some race conditions we've seen in bitswap where one node wants
a block but the other doesn't know for some reason.

You can track this issue here: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5183.

### Improved NAT Traversal

While NATs are still p2p enemy #1, this release includes slightly improved
support for traversing them.

Specifically, this release now:

1. Better detects the "gateway" NAT, even when multiple devices on the network
   _claim_ to be NATs.
2. Better guesses the external IP address when port mapping, even when the
   gateway lies.

### Reduced AutoRelay Boot Time

The experimental AutoRelay feature can now detect NATs _much_ faster as we've
reduced initial NAT detection delay to 15 seconds. There's still room for
improvement but this should make nodes that have enabled this feature dialable
earlier on start.

## v0.4.19 2019-03-01

We're happy to announce go 0.4.19. This release contains a bunch of important
fixes and a slew of new and improved features. Get pumped and upgrade ASAP to benefit from all the new goodies! 🎁

### Features

#### 🔌 Initializing With Random Ports

Go-ipfs can now be configured to listen on a random but _stable_ port (across
restarts) using the new `randomports` configuration profile. This should be
helpful when testing and/or running multiple go-ipfs instances on a single
machine.

To initialize a go-ipfs instance with a randomly chosen port, run:

```bash
> ipfs init --profile=randomports
```

#### 👂 Gateway Directory Listing

IPNS (and/or DNSLink) directory listings on the gateway, e.g.
https://ipfs.io/ipns/dist.ipfs.tech/go-ipfs/, will now display the _ipfs_ hash of
the current directory. This way users can more easily create permanent links to
otherwise mutable data.

#### 📡 AutoRelay and AutoNAT

This release introduces two new experimental features (courtesy of libp2p):
AutoRelay and AutoNAT.

AutoRelay is a new service that automatically chooses a public relay when it
detects that the go-ipfs node is behind a NAT. While relaying connections
through a third-party node isn't the most efficient way to route around NATs,
it's a reliable fallback.

To enable AutoRelay, set the `Swarm.EnableAutoRelay` option in the config.

AutoNAT is the service AutoRelay uses to detect if the node is behind a NAT. You
don't have to set any special config flags to enable it.

In this same config section, you may also notice options like `EnableRelayHop`,
`EnableAutoNATService`, etc. You _do not_ need to enable these:

* `EnableRelayHop` -- Allow _other_ nodes to use _your_ node as a relay
  (disabled by default).
* `EnableAutoNATService` -- Help _other_ nodes detect if they're behind a NAT
  (disabled by default).

#### 📵 Offline Operation

There are two new "offline" features in this release: a global `--offline` flag
and an option to configure the gateway to not fetch files.

Most go-ipfs commands now support the `--offline` flag. This causes IPFS to avoid
network operations when performing the requested operation. If you've ever used
the `--local` flag, the `--offline` flag is the (almost) universally supported
replacement.

For example:

* If the daemon is started with `ipfs daemon --offline`, it won't even _connect_
  to the network. (note: this feature isn't new, just an example).
* `ipfs add --offline some_file` won't send out provider records.
* `ipfs cat --offline Qm...` won't fetch any blocks from the network.
* `ipfs block stat --offline Qm...` is a great way to tell if a block is locally
  available.

Note: It doesn't _yet_ work with the `refs`, `urlstore`, or `tar` commands
([#6002](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6002)).

On to the gateway, there's a new `Gateway.NoFetch` option to configure the
gateway to only serve locally present files. This makes it possible to run an
IPFS node as a gateway to serve content of _your_ choosing without acting like a
public proxy. 🤫

#### 📍 Adding And Pinning Content

There's a new `--pin` flag for both `ipfs block put` and `ipfs urlstore add` to
match the `--pin` flag in `ipfs add`. This allows one to atomically add and pin
content with these APIs.

**NOTE 1:** For `ipfs urlstore add`, `--pin` has been enabled _by default_ to
match the behavior in `ipfs add`. However, `ipfs block put` _does not_ pin by
default to match the _current_ behavior.

**NOTE 2:** If you had previously used the urlstore and _weren't_ explicitly
pinning content after adding it, it isn't pinned and running the garbage
collector will delete it. While technically documented in the `ipfs urlstore
add` helptext, this behavior was non-obvious and bears mentioning.

#### 🗂 File Listing

The `ipfs ls` command has two significant changes this release: it reports
_file_ sizes instead of _dag_ sizes and has gained a new `--stream` flag.

First up, `ipfs ls` now reports _file_ sizes instead of _dag_ sizes. Previously,
for historical reasons, `ipfs ls` would report the size of a file/directory as
seen by IPFS _including_ all the filesystem datastructures and metadata.
However, this meant that `ls -l` and `ipfs ls` would print _different_ sizes:

```bash
> ipfs ls /ipfs/QmS4ustL54uo8FzR9455qaxZwuMiUhyvMcX9Ba8nUH4uVv

```

This is now no longer the case. `ipfs ls` and `ls -l` now return the _same_
sizes. 🙌

Second up, `ipfs ls` now has a new `--stream` flag. In IPFS, very large
directories (e.g., Wikipedia) are split up into multiple chunks (shards) as
there are too many entries to fit in a single block. Unfortunately, `ipfs ls`
buffers the _entire_ file list in memory and then sorts it. This means that
`ipfs ls /ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki` (wikipedia)
will take a _very_ long time to return anything (it'll also use quite a bit of
memory).

However, the new `--stream` flag makes it possible to stream a directory listing
as new chunks are fetched from the network. To test this, you can run `ipfs ls
--stream --size=false --resolve-type=false
/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki`. You probably won't
want to wait for that command to finish, Wikipedia has a _lot_ of entries. 😉

#### 🔁 HTTP Proxy

This release sees a new (experimental) feature contributed by our friends at
[Peergos](https://peergos.org): HTTP proxy over libp2p. When enabled, the local
gateway can act as an HTTP proxy and forward HTTP requests to libp2p peers. When
combined with the `ipfs p2p` command, users can use this to expose HTTP services
to other go-ipfs nodes via their gateways. For details, check out the
[documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#p2p-http-proxy).

### Performance And Reliability

This release introduces quite a few performance/reliability improvements and, as
usual, fixes several memory leaks. Below is a non-exhaustive list of noticeable changes.

#### 📞 DHT

This release includes an important DHT fix that should significantly:

1. Reduce dialing.
2. Speed up DHT queries.
3. Improve performance of the gateways.

Basically, in the worst case, a DHT query would turn into a random walk of the
entire IPFS network. Yikes!

Relevant PR: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/237

#### 🕸 Bitswap

Bitswap sessions have improved and are now used for _all_ requests. Sessions
allow us to group related content and ask peers most likely to _have_ the
content instead of broadcasting the request to all connected peers. This gives
us two significant benefits:

1. Less wasted upload bandwidth. Instead of broadcasting which blocks we want to
   everyone, we can ask fewer peers thus reducing the number of requests we send
   out.
2. Less wasted download bandwidth. Because we _know_ which peers likely have
   content, we can ask an individual peer for a block and expect to get an
   answer. In the past, we'd ask every peer at the same time to optimize for
   latency at the expense of bandwidth (getting the same block from multiple
   peers). We had to do this because we had to assume that _most_ peers didn't
   have the requested block.

#### ‼️ Pubsub

This release includes some significant reliability improvements in pubsub
subscription handling. If you've previously had issues with connected pubsub
peers _not_ seeing each-other's messages, please upgrade ASAP.

#### ♻️ Reuseport

In this release, we've rewritten our previously error-prone `go-reuseport`
library to _not_ duplicate a significant portion of Go's low-level networking
code. This was made possible by Go's new `Control`
[`net.Dialer`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dialer) option.

In the past, our first suggestion to anyone experiencing weird resource or
connectivity issues was to disable `REUSEPORT` (set `IPFS_REUSEPORT` to false).
This should no longer be necessary.

#### 🐺 Badger Datastore

[Badger has reached 1.0][badger-release]. This release brings an audit and
numerous reliability fixes. We are now reasonably confident that badger will
become the default datastore in a future release. 👍

[badger-release]: https://blog.dgraph.io/post/releasing-v1.0/

This release also adds a new `Truncate` configuration option for the badger
datastore (enabled by default for new IPFS nodes). When enabled, badger will
_delete_ any un-synced data on start instead of simply refusing to start. This
should be safe on all filesystems where the `sync` operation is safe and removes
the need for manual intervention when restarting an IPFS node after a crash.

Assuming you initialized your badger repo with `ipfs init --profile=badgerds`,
you can enable truncate on an existing repo by running: `ipfs config --json
"Datastore.Spec.child.truncate" true`.

### Refactors and Endeavors

#### 🕹 Commands Library

The legacy commands library shim has now been completely removed. This won't
mean much for many users but the go-ipfs team is happy to have this behind them.

#### 🌐 Base32 CIDs

This release can now encode CIDs in responses in bases other than base58. This
is primarily useful for web-browser integration as it allows us to (a) encode
CIDs in a lower-case base (e.g., base32) and then use them in the _origin_ part
of URLs. The take away is: this release brings us a step closer to better
browser integration.

Specifically, this release adds two flags:

1. `--cid-base`: When specified, the IPFS CLI will encode all CIDv1 CIDs using the
   requested base.
2. `--upgrade-cidv0-in-output`: When specified, the IPFS CLI will _upgrade_ CIDv0
   CIDs to CIDv1 CIDs when returning them to the user. This upgrade is necessary
   because CIDv0 doesn't support multibase however, it's off by default as it
   changes the _binary_ representation of the CIDs (which could have unintended
   consequences).

#### 🎛 CoreAPI

The work on the CoreAPI refactor ([ipfs/go-ipfs#4498][]) has progressed leaps and
bounds this release. The CoreAPI is a comprehensive programmatic interface
designed to allow go-ipfs be used as a daemon or a library interchangeably.

As of this release, go-ipfs now has:

* External interface definitions in [ipfs/interface-go-ipfs-core][].
* A work-in-progress implementation ([ipfs/go-ipfs-http-client][]) of these
  interfaces that uses the IPFS HTTP API. This will replace the
  ([ipfs/go-ipfs-api][]) library.
* A new plugin type ["Daemon"][daemon-plugin]. Daemon plugins are started and
  stopped along with the go-ipfs daemon and are instantiated with a copy of the
  CoreAPI. This allows them to control and extend the go-ipfs daemon from within
  the daemon itself.

The next steps are:

1. Finishing the remaining API surface area. At the moment, the two key missing
   parts are:
  1. Config manipulation.
  2. The `ipfs files` API.
1. Finalizing the [ipfs/go-ipfs-http-client][] implementation.
2. Creating a simple way to construct and initialize a go-ipfs node when using
   go-ipfs as a library.

## v0.4.18 2018-10-26

This is probably one of the largest go-ipfs releases in recent history, 3 months
in the making.

### Features

The headline features this release are experimental QUIC support, the gossipsub
pubsub routing algorithm, pubsub message signing, and a refactored `ipfs p2p`
command. However, that's just scratching the surface.

#### QUIC

First up, on the networking front, this release has also introduced experimental
support for the QUIC protocol. QUIC is a new UDP-based network transport that
solves many of the long standing issues with TCP.

For us, this means (eventually):

* **Fewer local resources.** TCP requires a file-descriptor per connection while
  QUIC (and most UDP based transports) can share a single file descriptor
  between all connections. This should allow us to dial faster and keep more
  connections open.
* **Faster connection establishment.** When client authentication is included,
  QUIC has a three-way handshake like TCP. However, unlike TCP, this handshake
  brings us from all the way from 0 to a fully encrypted, authenticated, and
  multiplexed connection. In theory (not yet in practice), this should
  significantly reduce the latency of DHT queries.
* **Behaves better on lossy networks.** When multiplexing multiple requests over
  a single TCP connection, a single dropped packet will bring the entire
  connection to a halt while the packet is re-transmitted. However, because QUIC
  handles multiplexing internally, dropping a single packets affects only the
  related stream.
* **Better NAT traversal.** TL;DR: NAT hole-punching is significantly easier
  and, in many cases, more reliable with UDP than with TCP.

However, we still have a long way to go. While we encourage users to test this,
the IETF QUIC protocol is still being actively developed and *will* change. You
can find instructions for enabling it
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#QUIC).

#### Pubsub

In terms of pubsub, go-ipfs now supports the gossipsub routing algorithm and
message signing.

The gossipsub routing algorithm is *significantly* more efficient than the
current floodsub routing algorithm. Even better, it's fully backwards compatible
so you can enable it and still talk to nodes using the floodsub algorithm. You
can find instructions to enable gossipsub in go-ipfs
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#gossipsub).

Messages are now signed by their authors. While signing has now been enabled by
default, strict signature verification has not been and will not be for at least
one release (probably multiple) to avoid breaking existing applications. You can
read about how to configure this feature
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#message-signing).

#### Commands

In terms of new toys, this release introduces a new `ipfs cid` subcommand for
working with CIDs, a completely refactored `ipfs p2p` command, streaming name
resolution, and complete inline block support.

The new `ipfs cid` command allows users to both inspect CIDs and convert them
between various formats and versions. For example:

```sh
# Print out the CID metadata (prefix)
> ipfs cid format -f %P QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
cidv0-protobuf-sha2-256-32

# Get the hex sha256 hash from the CID.
> ipfs cid format -b base16 -f '0x%D' QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
0x46d44814b9c5af141c3aaab7c05dc5e844ead5f91f12858b021eba45768b4c0e

# Convert a base58 v0 CID to a base32 v1 CID.
> ipfs cid base32 QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
bafybeicg2rebjoofv4kbyovkw7af3rpiitvnl6i7ckcywaq6xjcxnc2mby
```

The refactored `ipfs p2p` command allows forwarding TCP streams through two IPFS
nodes from one host to another. It's `ssh -L` but for IPFS. You can find
documentation
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#ipfs-p2p).
It's still experimental but we don't expect too many breaking changes at this
point (it will very likely be stabilized in the next release). Quick summary of
breaking changes:

* We don't stop listening for local (forwarded) connections after accepting a
  single connection.
* `ipfs p2p stream ls` output now returns more useful output, first address is
  always the initiator address.
* `ipfs p2p listener ls` is renamed to `ipfs p2p ls`
* `ipfs p2p listener close` is renamed to `ipfs p2p close`
* Protocol names have to be prefixed with `/x/` and are now just passed to
  libp2p as handler name. Previous version did this 'under the hood' and with
  `/p2p/` prefix. There is a `--allow-custom-protocol` flag which allows you
  to use any libp2p handler name.
* `ipfs p2p listener open` and `ipfs p2p stream dial` got renamed:
    * `ipfs p2p listener open p2p-test /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10101`
      new becomes `ipfs p2p listen /x/p2p-test /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10101`
    * `ipfs p2p stream dial $NODE_A_PEERID p2p-test /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10102`
      is now `ipfs p2p forward /x/p2p-test /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10102 /ipfs/$NODE_A_PEERID`

There is now a new flag for `ipfs name resolve` - `--stream`. When the command
is invoked with the flag set, it will start returning results as soon as they
are discovered in the DHT and other routing mechanisms. This enables certain
applications to start prefetching/displaying data while the discovery is still
running. Note that this command will likely return many outdated records
before it finding and returning the latest. However, it will always return
*valid* records (even if a bit stale).

Finally, in the previous release, we added support for extracting blocks inlined
into CIDs. In this release, we've added support for creating these CIDs. You can
now run `ipfs add` with the `--inline` flag to inline blocks less than or equal
to 32 bytes in length into a CID, instead of writing an actual block. This
should significantly reduce the size of filesystem trees with many empty
directories and tiny files.

#### IPNS

You can now publish and resolve paths with namespaces *other* than `/ipns` and
`/ipfs` through IPNS. Critically, IPNS can now be used with IPLD paths (paths
starting with `/ipld`).

#### WebUI

Finally, this release includes the shiny [updated
webui](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui). You can view it by
installing go-ipfs and visiting http://localhost:5001/webui.

### Performance

This release includes some significant performance improvements, both in terms
of resource utilization and speed. This section will go into some technical
details so feel free to skip it if you're just looking for shiny new features.

#### Resource Utilization

In this release, we've (a) fixed a slow memory leak in libp2p and (b)
significantly reduced the allocation load. Together, these should improve both
memory and CPU usage.

##### Datastructures

We've changed two of our most frequently used datastructures, CIDs and
Multiaddrs, to reduce allocation load.

First, we now store CIDs *encode* as strings, instead of decoded in structs
(behind pointers). In addition to being more compact, our `Cid` type is now a
valid `map` key so we no longer have to encode CIDs every time we want to use
them in a map/set. Allocations when inserting CIDs into maps/sets was showing up
as a significant source of allocations under heavy load so this change should
improve memory usage.

Second, we've changed many of our multiaddr parsing/processing/formatting
functions to allocate less. Much of our DHT related-work includes processing
multiaddrs so this should reduce CPU utilization when heavily using the DHT.

##### Streams and Yamux

Streams have always plagued us in terms of memory utilization. This was
partially solved by introducing the connection manager, keeping our maximum
connection count to a reasonable number but they're still a major memory sink.

This release sees two improvements on this front:

1. A memory [leak in identify](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/419)
   has been fixed. This was slowly causing us to leak connections (locking up
   the memory used by the connections' streams).
2. Yamux streams now use a buffer-pool backed, auto shrinking read buffer.
   Before, this read buffer would grow to its maximum size (a few megabytes) and
   never shrink but these buffers now shrink as they're emptied.

#### Bitswap Performance

Bitswap will now pack *multiple* small blocks into a single message thanks
[ipfs/go-bitswap#5](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/5). While this won't
help when transferring large files (with large blocks), this should help when
transferring many tiny files.

### Refactors and Endeavors

This release saw yet another commands-library refactor, work towards the
CoreAPI, and the first step towards reliable base32 CID support.

#### Commands Lib

We've completely refactored our commands library (again). While it still needs
quite a bit of work, it now requires significantly less boilerplate and should
be significantly more robust. The refactor immediately found two broken tests
and probably fixed quite a few bugs around properly returning and handling
errors.

#### CoreAPI

CoreAPI is a new way to interact with IPFS from Go. While it's still not
final, most things you can do via the CLI or HTTP interfaces, can now be done
through the new API.

Currently there is only one implementation, backed by go-ipfs node, and there are
plans to start http-api backed one soon. We are also looking into creating RPC
interface using this API, which could help performance in some use cases.

You can track progress in https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4498

#### IPLD paths

We introduced new path type which introduces distinction between IPLD and
IPFS (unixfs) paths. From now on paths prefixed with `/ipld/` will always
use IPLD link traversal and `/ipfs/` will use unixfs path resolver, which
takes things like shardnig into account.

Note that this is only initial support and there likely are some bugs in
how the paths are handled internally, so consider this feature
experimental for now.

#### CIDv1/Base32 Migration

Currently, IPFS is usually used in browsers by browsing to
`https://SOME_GATEWAY/ipfs/CID/...`. There are two significant drawbacks to this
approach:

1. From a browser security standpoint, all IPFS "sites" will live under the same
   origin (SOME_GATEWAY).
2. From a UX standpoint, this doesn't feel very "native" (even if the gateway is
   a local IPFS node).

To fix the security issue, we intend to switch IPFS gateway links
`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/CID` to to `https://CID.ipfs.dweb.link`. This way, the CID
will be a part of the
["origin"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) so
each IPFS website will get a separate security origin.

To fix the UX issue, we've been working on adding support for `ipfs://CID/...`
to web browsers through our
[ipfs-companion](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/) add-on and some new,
experimental extension APIs from Mozilla. This has the same effect of putting
the CID in the URL origin but has the added benefit of looking "native".

Unfortunately, origins must be *case insensitive*. Currently, most CIDs users
see are *CIDv0* CIDs (those starting with `Qm`) which are *always* base58
encoded and are therefore case-sensitive.

Fortunately, CIDv1 (the latest CID format) supports arbitrary bases using the
[multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/) standard. Unfortunately,
IPFS has always treated equivalent CIDv0 and CIDv1 CIDs as distinct. This means
that files added with CIDv0 CIDs (the default) can't be looked up using the
equivalent CIDv1.

This release makes some significant progress towards solving this issue by
introducing two features:

(1) The previous mentioned `ipfs cid base32` command for converting CID to a
case intensive encoding required by domain names. This command converts a CID to
version 1 and encodes it using base32.

(2) A hack to allow locally looking up blocks associated with a CIDv0 CID using
the equivalent CIDv1 CID (or the reverse). This hack will eventually
be replaced with a multihash indexed blockstore, which is agnostic to both the
CID version and multicodec content type.

## v0.4.17 2018-07-27

Ipfs 0.4.17 is a quick release to fix a major performance regression in bitswap
(mostly affecting go-ipfs -> js-ipfs transfers). However, while motivated by
this fix, this release contains a few other goodies that will excite some users.

The headline feature in this release is [urlstore][] support. Urlstore is a
generalization of the filestore backend that can fetch file blocks from remote
URLs on-demand instead of storing them in the local datastore.

Additionally, we've added support for extracting inline blocks from CIDs (blocks
inlined into CIDs using the identity hash function). However, go-ipfs won't yet
*create* such CIDs so you're unlikely to see any in the wild.

[urlstore]: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#ipfs-urlstore

Features:

* URLStore ([ipfs/go-ipfs#4896](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/4896))
* Add trickle-dag support to the urlstore ([ipfs/go-ipfs#5245](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5245)).
* Allow specifying how the data field in the `object get` is encoded ([ipfs/go-ipfs#5139](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5139))

* Add an efficient `--size-only` flag to the `repo stat` ([ipfs/go-ipfs#5010](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5010))
* Inline blocks in CIDs ([ipfs/go-ipfs#5117](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5117))

## v0.4.16 2018-07-13

Ipfs 0.4.16 is a fairly small release in terms of changes to the ipfs codebase,
but it contains a huge amount of changes and improvements from the libraries we
depend on, notably libp2p.

This release includes small a repo migration to account for some changes to the
DHT. It should only take a second to run but, depending on your configuration,
you may need to run it manually.

You can run a migration by either:

1. Selecting "Yes" when the daemon prompts you to migrate.
2. Running the daemon with the `--migrate=true` flag.
3. Manually [running](https://github.com/ipfs/fs-repo-migrations/blob/master/run.md#running-repo-migrations) the migration.

### Libp2p

This version of ipfs contains the changes made in libp2p from v5.0.14 through
v6.0.5. In that time, we have made significant changes to the codebase to allow
for easier integration of future transports and modules along with the usual
performance and reliability improvements. You can find many of these
improvements in the libp2p 6.0 [release blog
post](https://ipfs.io/blog/39-go-libp2p-6-0-0/).

The primary motivation for this refactor was adding support for network
transports like QUIC that have built-in support for encryption, authentication,
and stream multiplexing. It will also allow us to plug-in new security
transports (like TLS) without hard-coding them.

For example, our [QUIC
transport](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-quic-transport) currently works,
and can be plugged into libp2p manually (though note that it is still
experimental, as the upstream spec is still in flux). Further work is needed to
make enabling this inside ipfs easy and not require recompilation.

On the user-visible side of things, we've improved our dialing logic and
timeouts. We now abort dials to local subnets after 5 seconds and abort all
dials if the TCP handshake takes longer than 5 seconds. This should
significantly improve performance in some cases as we limit the number of
concurrent dials and slow dials to non-responsive peers have been known to clog
the dialer, blocking dials to reachable peers. Importantly, this should improve
DHT performance as it tends to spend a disproportional amount of time connecting
to peers.

We have also made a few noticeable changes to the DHT: we've significantly
improved the chances of finding a value on the DHT, tightened up some of our
validation logic, and fixed some issues that should reduce traffic to nodes
running in dhtclient mode over time.

Of these, the first one will likely see the most impact. In the past, when
putting a value (e.g., an IPNS entry) into the DHT, we'd try to put the value to
K peers (where K for us is 20). However, we'd often fail to connect to many of
these peers so we'd end up putting the value to significantly fewer than K
peers. We now try to put the value to the K peers we can actually connect to.

Finally, we've fixed JavaScript interoperability in go-multiplex, the one stream
muxer that both go-libp2p and js-libp2p implement. This should significantly
improve go-libp2p and js-libp2p interoperability.

### Multiformats

We are also changing the way that people write 'ipfs' multiaddrs. Currently,
ipfs multiaddrs look something like
`/ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ`.
However, calling them 'ipfs' multiaddrs is a bit misleading, as this is actually
the multiaddr of a libp2p peer that happens to run ipfs. Other protocols built
on libp2p right now still have to use multiaddrs that say 'ipfs', even if they
have nothing to do with ipfs. Therefore, we are renaming them to 'p2p'
multiaddrs. Moving forward, these addresses will be written as:
`/ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/p2p/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ`.

This release adds support for *parsing* both types of addresses (`.../ipfs/...`
and `.../p2p/...`) into the same network format, and the network format is
remaining exactly the same. A future release will have the ipfs daemon switch to
*printing* out addresses this way once a large enough portion of the network
has upgraded.

N.B., these addresses are *not* related to IPFS *file* names (`/ipfs/Qm...`).
Disambiguating the two was yet another motivation to switch the protocol name to
`/p2p/`.

### IPFS

On the ipfs side of things, we've started embedding public keys inside IPNS
records and have enabled the Git plugin by default.

Embedding public keys inside IPNS records allows lookups to be faster as we only
need to fetch the record itself (and not the public key separately). It also
fixes an issue where DHT peers wouldn't store a record for a peer if they didn't
have their public key already. Combined with some of the DHT and dialing fixes,
this should improve the performance of IPNS (once a majority of the network
updates).

Second, our public builds now include the Git plugin (in past builds, you could
add it yourself, but doing so was not easy). With this, ipfs can ingest and
operate over Git repositories and commit graphs directly. For more information
on this, see [the go-ipld-git repo](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-git).

Finally, we've included many smaller bugfixes, refactorings, improved
documentation, and a good bit more. For the full details, see the changelog

## v0.4.15 2018-05-09

This release is significantly smaller than the last as much of the work on
improving our datastores, and other libraries libp2p has yet to be merged.
However, it still includes many welcome improvements.

As with 0.4.12 and 0.4.14 (0.4.13 was a patch), this release has a negative
diff-stat. Unfortunately, much of this code isn't actually going away but at
least it's being moved out into separate repositories.

Much of the work that made it into this release is under the hood. We've cleaned
up some code, extracted several packages into their own repositories, and made
some long neglected optimizations (e.g., handling of sharded directories).
Additionally, this release includes a bunch of tests for our CLI commands that
should help us avoid some of the issues we've seen in the past few releases.

More visibly, thanks to @djdv's efforts, this release includes some significant
Windows improvements (with more on the way). Specifically, this release includes
better handling of repo lockfiles (no more `ipfs repo fsck`), stdin command-line
support, and, last but not least, IPFS no longer writes random files with scary
garbage in the drive root. To read more about future windows improvements, take
a look at this [blog post](https://blog.ipfs.io/36-a-look-at-windows/).

To better support low-power devices, we've added a low-power config profile.
This can be enabled when initializing a repo by running `ipfs init` with the
`--profile=lowpower` flag or later by running `ipfs config profile apply lowpower`.

Finally, with this release we have begun distributing self-contained source
archives of go-ipfs and its dependencies. This should be a welcome improvement
for both packagers and those living in countries with harmonized internet
access.

## v0.4.14 2018-03-22

Ipfs 0.4.14 is a big release with a large number of improvements and bugfixes.
It is also the first release of 2018, and our first release in over three
months. The release took longer than expected due to our refactoring and
extracting of our commands library. This refactor had two stages.  The first
round of the refactor disentangled the commands code from core ipfs code,
allowing us to move it out into a [separate
repository](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-cmds).  The code was previously
very entangled with the go-ipfs codebase and not usable for other projects.
The second round of the refactor had the goal of fixing several major issues
around streaming outputs, progress bars, and error handling. It also paved the
way for us to more easily provide an API over other transports, such as
websockets and unix domain sockets.  It took a while to flush out all the kinks
on such a massive change.  We're pretty sure we've got most of them, but if you
notice anything weird, please let us know.

Beyond that, we've added a new experimental way to use IPNS. With the new
pubsub IPNS resolver and publisher, you can subscribe to updates of an IPNS
entry, and the owner can publish out changes in real time. With this, IPNS can
become nearly instantaneous. To make use of this, simply start your ipfs daemon
with the `--enable-namesys-pubsub` option, and all IPNS resolution and
publishing will use pubsub. Note that resolving an IPNS name via pubsub without
someone publishing it via pubsub will result in a fallback to using the DHT.
Please give this a try and let us know how it goes!

Memory and CPU usage should see a noticeable improvement in this release. We
have spent considerable time fixing excess memory usage throughout the codebase
and down into libp2p. Fixes in peer tracking, bitswap allocation, pinning, and
many other places have brought down both peak and average memory usage. An
upgraded hashing library, base58 encoding library, and improved allocation
patterns all contribute to overall lower CPU usage across the board. See the
full changelist below for more memory and CPU usage improvements.

This release also brings the beginning of the ipfs 'Core API'. Once finished,
the Core API will be the primary way to interact with go-ipfs using go. Both
embedded nodes and nodes accessed over the http API will have the same
interface. Stay tuned for future updates and documentation.

These are only a sampling of the changes that made it into this release, the
full list (almost 100 PRs!) is below.

Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this release, whether
you're just contributing a typo fix or driving new features. We are really
grateful to everyone who has spent their their time pushing ipfs forward.

SECURITY NOTE:

This release of ipfs disallows the usage of insecure hash functions and
lengths. Ipfs does not create these insecure objects for any purpose, but it
did allow manually creating them and fetching them from other peers. If you
currently have objects using insecure hashes in your local ipfs repo, please
remove them before updating.

## v0.4.13 2017-11-16

Ipfs 0.4.13 is a patch release that fixes two high priority issues that were
discovered in the 0.4.12 release.

Bugfixes:
  - Fix periodic bitswap deadlock ([ipfs/go-ipfs#4386](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/4386))
  - Fix badgerds crash on startup ([ipfs/go-ipfs#4384](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/4384))


## v0.4.12 2017-11-09

Ipfs 0.4.12 brings with it many important fixes for the huge spike in network
size we've seen this past month. These changes include the Connection Manager,
faster batching in `ipfs add`, libp2p fixes that reduce CPU usage, and a bunch
of new documentation.

The most critical change is the 'Connection Manager': it allows an ipfs node to
maintain a limited set of connections to other peers in the network. By default
(and with no config changes required by the user), ipfs nodes will now try to
maintain between 600 and 900 open connections. These limits are still likely
higher than needed, and future releases may lower the default recommendation,
but for now we want to make changes gradually. The rationale for this selection
of numbers is as follows:

- The DHT routing table for a large network may rise to around 400 peers
- Bitswap connections tend to be separate from the DHT
- PubSub connections also generally are another distinct set of peers
  (including js-ipfs nodes)

Because of this, we selected 600 as a 'LowWater' number, and 900 as a
'HighWater' number to avoid having to clear out connections too frequently.
You can configure different numbers as you see fit via the `Swarm.ConnMgr`
field in your ipfs config file. See
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#connmgr) for
more details.

Disk utilization during `ipfs add` has been optimized for large files by doing
batch writes in parallel. Previously, when adding a large file, users might have
noticed that the add progressed by about 8MB at a time, with brief pauses in between.
This was caused by quickly filling up the batch, then blocking while it was
writing to disk. We now write to disk in the background while continuing to add
the remainder of the file.

Other changes in this release have noticeably reduced memory consumption and CPU
usage. This was done by optimising some frequently called functions in libp2p
that were expensive in terms of both CPU usage and memory allocations. We also
lowered the yamux accept buffer sizes which were raised over a year ago to
combat a separate bug that has since been fixed.

And finally, thank you to everyone who filed bugs, tested out the release candidates,
filed pull requests, and contributed in any other way to this release!

### v0.4.11 2017-09-14

Ipfs 0.4.11 is a larger release that brings many long-awaited features and
performance improvements. These include new datastore options, more efficient
bitswap transfers, greatly improved resource consumption, circuit relay
support, ipld plugins, and more! Take a look at the full changelog below for a
detailed list of every change.

The ipfs datastore has, until now, been a combination of leveldb and a custom
git-like storage backend called 'flatfs'. This works well enough for the
average user, but different ipfs usecases demand different backend
configurations. To address this, we have changed the configuration file format
for datastores to be a modular way of specifying exactly how you want the
datastore to be structured. You will now be able to configure ipfs to use
flatfs, leveldb, badger, an in-memory datastore, and more to suit your needs.
See the new [datastore
documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/datastores.md)
for more information.

Bitswap received some much needed attention during this release cycle. The
concept of 'Bitswap Sessions' allows bitswap to associate requests for
different blocks to the same underlying session, and from that infer better
ways of requesting that data. In more concrete terms, parts of the ipfs
codebase that take advantage of sessions (currently, only `ipfs pin add`) will
cause much less extra traffic than before. This is done by making optimistic
guesses about which nodes might be providing given blocks and not sending
wantlist updates to every connected bitswap partner, as well as searching the
DHT for providers less frequently. In future releases we will migrate over more
ipfs commands to take advantage of bitswap sessions. As nodes update to this
and future versions, expect to see idle bandwidth usage on the ipfs network
go down noticeably.

The never ending effort to reduce resource consumption had a few important
updates this release. First, the bitswap sessions changes discussed above will
help with improving bandwidth usage. Aside from that there are two important
libp2p updates that improved things significantly. The first was a fix to a bug
in the dial limiter code that was causing it to not limit outgoing dials
correctly. This resulted in ipfs running out of file descriptors very
frequently (as well as incurring a decent amount of excess outgoing bandwidth),
this has now been fixed. Users who previously received "too many open files"
errors should see this much less often in 0.4.11. The second change was a
memory leak in the DHT that was identified and fixed. Streams being tracked in
a map in the DHT weren't being cleaned up after the peer disconnected leading
to the multiplexer session not being cleaned up properly. This issue has been
resolved, and now memory usage appears to be stable over time. There is still a
lot of work to be done improving memory usage, but we feel this is a solid
victory.

It is often said that NAT traversal is the hardest problem in peer to peer
technology, we tend to agree with this. In an effort to provide a more
ubiquitous p2p mesh, we have implemented a relay mechanism that allows willing
peers to relay traffic for other peers who might not otherwise be able to
communicate with each other.  This feature is still pretty early, and currently
users have to manually connect through a relay. The next step in this endeavour
is automatic relaying, and research for this is currently in progress. We
expect that when it lands, it will improve the perceived performance of ipfs by
spending less time attempting connections to hard to reach nodes. A short guide
on using the circuit relay feature can be found
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#circuit-relay).

The last feature we want to highlight (but by no means the last feature in this
release) is our new plugin system. There are many different workflows and
usecases that ipfs should be able to support, but not everyone wants to be able
to use every feature. We could simply merge in all these features, but that
causes problems for several reasons: first off, the size of the ipfs binary
starts to get very large very quickly. Second, each of these different pieces
needs to be maintained and updated independently, which would cause significant
churn in the codebase. To address this, we have come up with a system that
allows users to install plugins to the vanilla ipfs daemon that augment its
capabilities. The first of these plugins are a [git
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/plugin/plugins/git/git.go)
that allows ipfs to natively address git objects and an [ethereum
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-eth) that lets ipfs ingest and operate
on all ethereum blockchain data. Soon to come are plugins for the bitcoin and
zcash data formats. In the future, we will be adding plugins for other things
like datastore backends and specialized libp2p network transports.
You can read more on this topic in [Plugin docs](docs/plugins.md)

In order to simplify its integration with fs-repo-migrations, we've switched
the ipfs/go-ipfs docker image from a musl base to a glibc base. For most users
this will not be noticeable, but if you've been building your own images based
off this image, you'll have to update your dockerfile. We recommend a
multi-stage dockerfile, where the build stage is based off of a regular Debian or
other glibc-based image, and the assembly stage is based off of the ipfs/go-ipfs
image, and you copy build artifacts from the build stage to the assembly
stage. Note, if you are using the docker image and see a deprecation message,
please update your usage. We will stop supporting the old method of starting
the dockerfile in the next release.

Finally, I would like to thank all of our contributors, users, supporters, and
friends for helping us along the way. Ipfs would not be where it is without
you.

### v0.4.10 - 2017-06-27

Ipfs 0.4.10 is a patch release that contains several exciting new features,
bugfixes and general improvements. Including new commands, easier corruption
recovery, and a generally cleaner codebase.

The `ipfs pin` command has two new subcommands, `verify` and `update`. `ipfs
pin verify` is used to scan the repo for pinned object graphs and check their
integrity. Any issues are reported back with helpful error text to make error
recovery simpler.  This subcommand was added to help recover from datastore
corruptions, particularly if using the experimental filestore and accidentally
deleting tracked files.
`ipfs pin update` was added to make the task of keeping a large, frequently
changing object graph pinned. Previously users had to call `ipfs pin rm` on the
old pin, and `ipfs pin add` on the new one. The 'new' `ipfs pin add` call would
be very expensive as it would need to verify the entirety of the graph again.
The `ipfs pin update` command takes shortcuts, portions of the graph that were
covered under the old pin are assumed to be fine, and the command skips
checking them.

Next up, we have finally implemented an `ipfs shutdown` command so users can
shut down their ipfs daemons via the API. This is especially useful on
platforms that make it difficult to control processes (Android, for example),
and is also useful when needing to shut down a node remotely and you do not
have access to the machine itself.

`ipfs add` has gained a new flag; the `--hash` flag allows you to select which
hash function to use and we have given it the ability to select `blake2b-256`.
This pushes us one step closer to shifting over to using blake2b as the
default. Blake2b is significantly faster than sha2-256, and also is conjectured
to provide superior security.

We have also finally implemented a very early (and experimental) `ipfs p2p`.
This command and its subcommands will allow you to open up arbitrary streams to
other ipfs peers through libp2p. The interfaces are a little bit clunky right
now, but shouldn't get in the way of anyone wanting to try building a fully
peer to peer application on top of ipfs and libp2p. For more info on this
command, to ask questions, or to provide feedback, head over to the [feedback
issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3994) for the command.

### v0.4.9 - 2017-04-30

Ipfs 0.4.9 is a maintenance release that contains several useful bugfixes and
improvements. Notably, `ipfs add` has gained the ability to select which CID
version will be output. The common ipfs hash that looks like this:
`QmRjNgF2mRLDT8AzCPsQbw1EYF2hDTFgfUmJokJPhCApYP` is a multihash. Multihashes
allow us to specify the hashing algorithm that was used to verify the data, but
it doesn't give us any indication of what format that data might be. To address
that issue, we are adding another couple of bytes to the prefix that will allow us
to indicate the format of the data referenced by the hash. This new format is
called a Content ID, or CID for short. The previous bare multihashes will still
be fully supported throughout the entire application as CID version 0. The new
format with the type information will be CID version 1. To give an example,
the content referenced by the hash above is "Hello Ipfs!". That same content,
in the same format (dag-protobuf) using CIDv1 is
`zb2rhkgXZVkT2xvDiuUsJENPSbWJy7fdYnsboLBzzEjjZMRoG`.

CIDv1 hashes are supported in ipfs versions back to 0.4.5. Nodes running 0.4.4
and older will not be able to load content via CIDv1 and we recommend that they
update to a newer version.

There are many other use cases for CIDs. Plugins can be written to
allow ipfs to natively address content from any other merkletree based system,
such as git, bitcoin, zcash and ethereum -- a few systems we've already started work on.

Aside from the CID flag, there were many other changes as noted below:

- Features
  - Add support for using CidV1 in 'ipfs add' ([ipfs/go-ipfs#3743](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/3743))

### v0.4.8 - 2017-03-29

Ipfs 0.4.8 brings with it several improvements, bugfixes, documentation
improvements, and the long awaited directory sharding code.

Currently, when too many items are added into a unixfs directory, the object
gets too large and you may experience issues. To pervent this problem, and
generally make working really large directories more efficient, we have
implemented a HAMT structure for unixfs. To enable this feature, run:
```
ipfs config --json Experimental.ShardingEnabled true
```

And restart your daemon if it was running.

Note: With this setting enabled, the hashes of any newly added directories will
be different than they previously were, as the new code will use the sharded
HAMT structure for all directories. Also, nodes running ipfs 0.4.7 and earlier
will not be able to access directories created with this option.

That said, please do give it a try, let us know how it goes, and then take a
look at all the other cool things added in 0.4.8 below.

### v0.4.7 - 2017-03-15

Ipfs 0.4.7 contains several exciting new features!
First off, The long awaited filestore feature has been merged, allowing users
the option to not have ipfs store chunked copies of added files in the
blockstore, pushing to burden of ensuring those files are not changed to the
user. The filestore feature is currently still experimental, and must be
enabled in your config with:
```
ipfs config --json Experimental.FilestoreEnabled true
```
before it can be used. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3397#issuecomment-284337564) for more details.

Next up, We have merged initial support for ipfs 'Private Networks'. This
feature allows users to run ipfs in a mode that will only connect to other
peers in the private network. This feature, like the filestore is being
released experimentally, but if you're interested please try it out.
Instructions for setting it up can be found
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3397#issuecomment-284341649).

This release also enables support for the 'mplex' stream muxer by default. This
stream multiplexing protocol was available previously via the
`--enable-mplex-experiment` daemon flag, but has now graduated to being 'less
experimental' and no longer requires the flag to use it.

Aside from those, we have a good number of bugfixes, perf improvements and new
tests. Heres a list of highlights:

## v0.4.3-rc1 - 2016-07-23

This is a maintenance release which comes with a couple of nice enhancements, and improves the performance of Storage, Bitswap, as well as Content and Peer Routing. It also introduces a handful of new commands and options, and fixes a good bunch of bugs.

This is the first Release Candidate. Unless there are vulnerabilities or regressions discovered, the final 0.4.3 release will happen about one week from now.

- Security Vulnerability

  - The `master` branch if go-ipfs suffered from a vulnerability for about 3 weeks. It allowed an attacker to use an iframe to request malicious HTML and JS from the API of a local go-ipfs node. The attacker could then gain unrestricted access to the node's API, and e.g. extract the private key. We fixed this issue by reintroducing restrictions on which particular objects can be loaded through the API (@lgierth, [ipfs/go-ipfs#2949](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2949)), and by completely excluding the private key from the API (@Kubuxu, [ipfs/go-ipfs#2957](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2957)). We will also work on more hardening of the API in the next release.
  - **The previous release 0.4.2 is not vulnerable. That means if you're using official binaries from [dist.ipfs.tech](https://dist.ipfs.tech) you're not affected.** If you're running go-ipfs built from the `master` branch between June 17th ([ipfs/go-ipfs@1afebc21](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/commit/1afebc21f324982141ca8a29710da0d6f83ca804)) and July 7th ([ipfs/go-ipfs@39bef0d5](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/commit/39bef0d5b01f70abf679fca2c4d078a2d55620e2)), please update to v0.4.3-rc1 immediately.
  - We are grateful to the group of independent researchers who made us aware of this vulnerability. We wanna use this opportunity to reiterate that we're very happy about any additional review of pull requests and releases. You can contact us any time at security@ipfs.io (GPG [4B9665FB 92636D17 7C7A86D3 50AAE8A9 59B13AF3](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x50AAE8A959B13AF3)).

## v0.4.0 - 2016-04-05

This is a major release with plenty of new features and bugfixes.
It also includes breaking changes which make it incompatible with v0.3.x
on the networking layer.

* Major Changes
  * Multistream
    * The addition of multistream is a breaking change on the networking layer,
      but gives IPFS implementations the ability to mix and match different
      stream multiplexers, e.g. yamux, spdystream, or muxado.
      This adds a ton of flexibility on one of the lower layers of the protocol,
      and will help us avoid further breaking protocol changes in the future.
  * Files API
    * The new `files` command and API allow a program to interact with IPFS
      using familiar filesystem operations, namely: creating directories,
      reading, writing, and deleting files, listing out different directories,
      and so on. This feature enables any other application that uses a
      filesystem-like backend for storage, to use IPFS as its storage driver
      without having change the application logic at all.
  * Gx
    * go-ipfs now uses [gx](https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx) to manage its
      dependencies. This means that under the hood, go-ipfs's dependencies are
      backed by IPFS itself! It also means that go-ipfs is no longer installed
      using `go get`. Use `make install` instead.
* New Features
  * Web UI
    * Update to new version which is compatible with 0.4.0. (@dignifiedquire)
  * Networking
    * Implement uTP transport. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Allow multiple addresses per configured bootstrap node. (@whyrusleeping)
  * IPNS
    * Improve IPNS resolution performance. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Have dnslink prefer `TXT _dnslink.example.com`, allows usage of CNAME records. (@Kubuxu)
    * Prevent `ipfs name publish` when `/ipns` is mounted. (@noffle)
  * Repo
    * Improve performance of `ipfs add`. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Add `Datastore.NoSync` config option for flatfs. (@rht)
    * Implement mark-and-sweep GC. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Allow for GC during `ipfs add`. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Add `ipfs repo stat` command. (@tmg, @diasdavid)
  * General
    * Add support for HTTP OPTIONS requests. (@lidel)
    * Add `ipfs diag cmds` to view active API requests (@whyrusleeping)
    * Add an `IPFS_LOW_MEM` environment variable which relaxes Bitswap's memory usage. (@whyrusleeping)
    * The Docker image now lives at `ipfs/go-ipfs` and has been completely reworked. (@lgierth)
* Security fixes
  * The gateway path prefix added in v0.3.10 was vulnerable to cross-site
    scripting attacks. This release introduces a configurable list of allowed
    path prefixes. It's called `Gateway.PathPrefixes` and takes a list of
    strings, e.g. `["/blog", "/foo/bar"]`. The v0.3.x line will not receive any
    further updates, so please update to v0.4.0 as soon as possible. (@lgierth)
