### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Boxo under the covers
We have consolidated many IPFS repos into [Boxo](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo), and this release switches Kubo over to use Boxo instead of those repos, resulting in the removal of 27 dependencies from Kubo:

- github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap
- github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-files
- github.com/ipfs/tar-utils
- gihtub.com/ipfs/go-block-format

- github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs
- github.com/ipfs/go-pinning-service-http-client

Note: if you consume these in your own code, we recommend migrating to Boxo. To ease this process, there's a [tool which will help migrate your code to Boxo](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo#migrating-to-box).

You can learn more about the [Boxo 0.8 release](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.8.0) that Kubo now depends and the general effort to get Boxo to be a stable foundation [here](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/issues/196).

---

Per usual, various bug and performance fixes.  
Anything regarding boxo updates we want to say?

#### HTTP Gateway

##### Switch to `boxo/gateway` library

Gateway code was extracted and refactored into a standalone library that now
lives in [boxo/gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/gateway). This
enabled us to clean up some legacy code and remove dependency on Kubo
internals.

The GO API is still being refined, but now operates on higher level abstraction
defined by `gateway.IPFSBackend` interface.  It is now possible to embed
gateway functionality without the rest of Kubo.

See the [car](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/examples/gateway/car)
and [proxy](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/examples/gateway/proxy)
examples, or more advanced
[bifrost-gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/bifrost-gateway).

##### Improved testing

We are also in the progress of moving away from gateway testing being based on
Kubo sharness tests, and are working on
[ipfs/gateway-conformance](https://github.com/ipfs/gateway-conformance) test
suite that is vendor agnostic and can be run against arbitrary HTTP endpoint to
test specific subset of [HTTP Gateways specifications](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/).

##### Trace Context support

We've introduced initial support for `traceparent` header from [W3C's Trace
Context spec](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/).

If `traceparent` header is
present in the gateway request, one can use its `trace-id` part to inspect
trace spans via selected exporter such as Jaeger UI
([docs](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/blob/main/docs/tracing.md#using-jaeger-ui),
[demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/231312374-bafc2035-1fc6-4d6b-901b-9e4af039807c.png)).

To learn more, see [tracing docs](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/blob/main/docs/tracing.md).

##### Removed legacy features

- Some Kubo-specific prometheus metrics are no longer available.
  - An up-to-date list of gateway metrics can be found in [boxo/gateway/metrics.go](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/blob/main/gateway/metrics.go).
- The legacy opt-in `Gateway.Writable` is no longer available as of Kubo 0.20.
  - We are working on developing a modern replacement.
