### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Add search functionality for pin names

It is now possible to search for pins by name. To do so, use `ipfs pin ls --name "SomeName"`. The search is case-sensitive and will return all pins having a name which contains the exact word provided.

#### Global configuration for data ingestion

A new configuration section, `Import`, was introduced. This section allows to override the default values of options used across several commands that do data ingestion. Read more in the [config documentation](../config.md).
