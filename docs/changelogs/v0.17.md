#### libp2p resource management enabled by default

To help protect nodes from DoS (resource exhaustion) and eclipse attacks, 
go-libp2p released a [Network Resource Manager](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/tree/master/p2p/host/resource-manager) with a host of improvements throughout 2022.  

Kubo first [exposed this functionality in Kubo 0.13](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.13.md#-libp2p-network-resource-manager-swarmresourcemgr), 
but it was disabled by default.

The resource manager is now enabled by default to protect nodes.  
The defaults balance providing protection from various attacks while still enabling normal usecases to work as expected.

If you want to adjust the defaults, then you can:
1. bound the amount of memory and file descriptors that libp2p will use with [Swarm.ResourceMgr.MaxMemory](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmresourcemgrmaxmemory) 
and [Swarm.ResourceMgr.MaxFileDescriptors](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmresourcemgrmaxfiledescriptors) and/or
2. override any specific resource scopes/limits with [Swarm.ResourceMgr.Limits](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmresourcemgrlimits)

See [Swarm.ResourceMgr](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmresourcemgr) for
1. what limits are set by default,
2. example override configuration, 
3. how to access prometheus metrics and view grafana dashboards of resource usage, and 
4. how to set explicit "allow lists" to protect against eclipse attacks. 

#### Implicit connection manager limits

Starting with this release, `ipfs init` will no longer store the default
[Connection Manager](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmconnmgr)
limits in the user config under `Swarm.ConnMgr`.

Users are still free to use this setting to set custom values, but for most use
cases, the defaults provided with the latest Kubo release should be sufficient.

To remove any custom limits and switch to the implicit defaults managed by Kubo:

```console
$ ipfs config --json Swarm.ConnMgr '{}'
```

We will be adjusting defaults in the future releases.

#### TAR Response Format on Gateways

Implemented [IPIP-288](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/288) which adds
support for requesting deserialized UnixFS directory as a TAR stream.

HTTP clients can request TAR response by passing the `?format=tar` URL
parameter, or setting `Accept: application/x-tar` HTTP header:

```console
$ export DIR_CID=bafybeigccimv3zqm5g4jt363faybagywkvqbrismoquogimy7kvz2sj7sq
$ curl -H "Accept: application/x-tar" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$DIR_CID" > dir.tar
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$DIR_CID?format=tar" | tar xv

#### Dialling `/wss` peer behind a reverse proxy

This release resolves a regression introduced in Kubo 0.16, making it possible
again to connect to a peer over a WebSockets endpoint (`/wss`) that is
deployed behind a reverse proxy.
