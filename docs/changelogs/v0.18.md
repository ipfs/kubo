### ðŸ”¦ Highlights

#### (DAG-)JSON and (DAG-)CBOR Response Formats on Gateways

Implemented [IPIP-328](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/328) which adds support
to DAG-JSON and DAG-CBOR, as well as their non-DAG variants, to the gateway. Now,
CIDs that encode JSON, CBOR, DAG-JSON and DAG-CBOR objects can be retrieved, and
traversed thanks to the [special meaning of CBOR Tag 42](https://github.com/ipld/cid-cbor/).

HTTP clients can request JSON, CBOR, DAG-JSON, and DAG-CBOR responses by either
passing the query parameter `?format` or setting the `Accept` HTTP header to the
following values:

- JSON: `?format=json`, or `Accept: application/json`
- CBOR: `?format=cbor`, or `Accept: application/cbor`
- DAG-JSON: `?format=dag-json`, or `Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-json`
- DAG-JSON: `?format=dag-cbor`, or `Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-cbor`

```console
$ export DIR_CID=bafybeigccimv3zqm5g4jt363faybagywkvqbrismoquogimy7kvz2sj7sq

#### Content Routing

Content routing is the process of discovering which peers provide a piece of content. Kubo has traditionally only supported [libp2p's implementation of Kademlia DHT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/kad-dht) for content routing.

Kubo can now bridge networks by including support for the [delegated routing HTTP API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/337). Users can compose content routers using the `Routing.Routers` config, to pick content routers with different tradeoffs than a Kademlia DHT (for example, high-performance and high-capacity centralized endpoints, dedicated Kademlia DHT nodes, routers with unique provider records, privacy-focused content routers, etc.).

One example is [InterPlanetary Network Indexers](https://github.com/ipni/specs/blob/main/IPNI.md#readme), which are HTTP endpoints that cache records from both the IPFS network and other sources such as web3.storage and Filecoin. This improves not only content availability by enabling Kubo to transparently fetch content directly from Filecoin storage providers, but also improves IPFS content routing latency by an order of magnitude and decreases resource consumption.
*Note:* it's possible to retrieve content stored by Filecoin Storage Providers (SPs) from Kubo if the SPs service Bitswap requests.  As of this release, some SPs are advertising Bitswap.  You can follow the roadmap progress for IPNIs and Bitswap in SPs [here](https://www.starmaps.app/roadmap/github.com/protocol/bedrock/issues/1).

In this release, the default content router is changed from `dht` to `auto`. The `auto` router includes the IPFS DHT in addition to the [cid.contact](https://cid.contact) IPNI instance. In future releases, we plan to expand the functionality of `auto` to encompass automatic discovery of content routers, which will improve performance and content availability (for example, see [IPIP-342](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/342)).

Previous behavior can be restored by setting `Routing.Type` to `dht`.

Alternative routing rules, including alternative IPNI endpoints, can be configured in `Routing.Routers` after setting `Routing.Type` to `custom`.

Learn more in [`Routing` docs](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routing).

#### Increased `Reprovider.Interval`

Default changed from 12h to 22h.
We also stopped `ipfs init` from hardcoding the default value in user config, allowing Kubo to adjust implicit default in future releases.

Rationale for increasing this can be found in [RFM 17: Provider Record Livenes Report](https://github.com/protocol/network-measurements/blob/master/results/rfm17-provider-record-liveness.md)
and [kubo#9326](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9326).

#### Lowered `ConnMgr`
