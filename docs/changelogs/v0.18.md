### 🔦 Highlights

#### (DAG-)JSON and (DAG-)CBOR Response Formats on Gateways

Implemented [IPIP-328](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/328) which adds support
to DAG-JSON and DAG-CBOR, as well as their non-DAG variants, to the gateway. Now,
CIDs that encode JSON, CBOR, DAG-JSON and DAG-CBOR objects can be retrieved, and
traversed thanks to the [special meaning of CBOR Tag 42](https://github.com/ipld/cid-cbor/).

HTTP clients can request JSON, CBOR, DAG-JSON, and DAG-CBOR responses by either
passing the query parameter `?format` or setting the `Accept` HTTP header to the
following values:

- JSON: `?format=json`, or `Accept: application/json`
- CBOR: `?format=cbor`, or `Accept: application/cbor`
- DAG-JSON: `?format=dag-json`, or `Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-json`
- DAG-JSON: `?format=dag-cbor`, or `Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-cbor`

```console
$ export DIR_CID=bafybeigccimv3zqm5g4jt363faybagywkvqbrismoquogimy7kvz2sj7sq
$ curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-json" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$DIR_CID" | jq
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$DIR_CID?format=dag-json" | jq

  ]
}
```

#### 🐎 Fast directory listings with DAG sizes

Fast listings are now enabled for _all_ UnixFS directories: big and small.
There is no linear slowdown caused by reading size metadata from child nodes,
and the size of DAG representing child items is always present.

As an example, the CID
`bafybeiggvykl7skb2ndlmacg2k5modvudocffxjesexlod2pfvg5yhwrqm` represents UnixFS
directory with over 10k (10100) of files. Listing big directories was fast
since Kubo 0.13, but in this release it will also include the size column.

#### Content Routing

Content routing is the process of discovering which peers provide a piece of content. Kubo has traditionally only supported [libp2p's implementation of Kademlia DHT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/kad-dht) for content routing.

Kubo can now bridge networks by including support for the [delegated routing HTTP API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/337). Users can compose content routers using the `Routing.Routers` config, to pick content routers with different tradeoffs than a Kademlia DHT (for example, high-performance and high-capacity centralized endpoints, dedicated Kademlia DHT nodes, routers with unique provider records, privacy-focused content routers, etc.).

One example is [InterPlanetary Network Indexers](https://github.com/ipni/specs/blob/main/IPNI.md#readme), which are HTTP endpoints that cache records from both the IPFS network and other sources such as web3.storage and Filecoin. This improves not only content availability by enabling Kubo to transparently fetch content directly from Filecoin storage providers, but also improves IPFS content routing latency by an order of magnitude and decreases resource consumption.
*Note:* it's possible to retrieve content stored by Filecoin Storage Providers (SPs) from Kubo if the SPs service Bitswap requests.  As of this release, some SPs are advertising Bitswap.  You can follow the roadmap progress for IPNIs and Bitswap in SPs [here](https://www.starmaps.app/roadmap/github.com/protocol/bedrock/issues/1).

In this release, the default content router is changed from `dht` to `auto`. The `auto` router includes the IPFS DHT in addition to the [cid.contact](https://cid.contact) IPNI instance. In future releases, we plan to expand the functionality of `auto` to encompass automatic discovery of content routers, which will improve performance and content availability (for example, see [IPIP-342](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/342)).

Previous behavior can be restored by setting `Routing.Type` to `dht`.

Alternative routing rules, including alternative IPNI endpoints, can be configured in `Routing.Routers` after setting `Routing.Type` to `custom`.

#### WebTransport enabled by default

[WebTransport](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/1717) is a new libp2p transport that [has been introduced in v0.16](v0.16.md#-webtransport-new-experimental-transport) that is based on top of QUIC and HTTP3.

This allows browsers to contact Kubo nodes, so now instead of just serving requests for other system level applicative nodes, you can also serve requests directly to a browser.
For the full story see [connectivity.libp2p.io](https://connectivity.libp2p.io/).

##### WebTransport + QUIC on one single port

The new feature that allows us to ship WebTransport by default is that [go-libp2p now supports running WebTransport and QUIC transports on the same QUIC listener](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/1759).

To use this feature, you just have to register two listen address on the same `/ipX/.../udp/XXX` prefix.

#### QUICv1 & WebTransport Config Migration

Go-libp2p now differentiate the first version of QUIC we implemented (and were using until then), `Draft-29`, and the ratified protocol in RFC9000, `QUICv1`.
This manifest as two different multiaddr components `/quic` (old Draft-29) and `/quic-v1`.

Even tho Draft-29 and QUICv1 are similar they are not fully inter-compatible, go-libp2p do supports listening with both versions on one single listener.

`/webtransport` now also need to be prefixed by a `/quic-v1` instead of `/quic` component.
This has no protocol change, WebTransport only supports QUICv1 and were running on QUICv1 already.

To support QUICv1 and WebTransport by default we run a new migration (n°`13`) which automatically add entries in addresses related fields in the config:
- Replace all `/quic/webtransport` to `/quic-v1/webtransport`.
- For all `/quic` listener, keep the Draft-29 listener, and on the same ip and port, add `/quic-v1` and `/quic-v1/webtransport` listeners.

##### `/quic` (Draft-29) early-deprecation

We plan to remove support for QUIC Draft-29 in the mid to long term future.

You must not use `/quic` for new deployements and use `/quic-v1` instead.

#### Provider Record Republish and Expiration

Default `Reprovider.Interval` changed from 12h to 22h to match new defaults for the Provider Record Expiration (48h) in [go-libp2p-kad-dht v0.20.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.20.0).

Rationale for increasing this can be found in
[RFM 17: Provider Record Livenes Report](https://github.com/protocol/network-measurements/blob/master/results/rfm17-provider-record-liveness.md),
[kubo#9326](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9326),
and the upstream DHT specifications at [libp2p/specs#451](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/451).
