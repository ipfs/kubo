### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### `ipfs name publish` now supports V2 only IPNS records

When publishing an IPNS record, you are now able to create v2 only records
by passing `--v1compat=false`. By default, we still create V1+V2 records, such
that there is the highest chance of backwards compatibility. The goal is to move
to V2 only in the future.

**TODO**: add links to IPIP https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/376

#### IPNS name resolution has been fixed

IPNS name resolution had a regression where if IPNS over PubSub was enabled, but the name was not also available via IPNS over PubSub it would take 1 minute to for the lookup to complete (if the record was not yet cached).

This has been fixed and as before will give the best record from either the DHT subsystem or IPNS over PubSub, whichever comes back first.

For details see [#9927](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9927) and [#10020](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10020).
