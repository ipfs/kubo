### Overview

### üî¶ Highlights

#### Gateway: support for `order=` and `dups=` parameters (IPIP-412)

The updated [`boxo/gateway` library](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/gateway)
introduces support for ordered CAR responses through the inclusion of optional
CAR content type parameters: `order=dfs` and `dups=y|n` from
[IPIP-412](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/412).

Previously, Kubo already provided CARs in DFS order without duplicate blocks.
With the implementation of IPIP-412, this behavior is now explicitly defined
rather than implied.

In the absence of `dups` or `order` in `Accept` request reader, the default CAR
response will have the `Content-Type: application/vnd.ipld.car; version=1; order=dfs; dups=n`
and the same blocks as Kubo 0.21.

Kubo 0.22 still only supports DFS block ordering (`order=dfs`). However, it is
now possible to request a DFS CAR stream with duplicate blocks by opting in via
`Accept: application/vnd.ipld.car; order=dfs; dups=y`. This opt-in feature can be
beneficial for memory-constrained clients and IoT devices, as it allows for
streaming large DAGs without the need to store all previously encountered
blocks in memory.

#### `ipfs name publish` now supports V2 only IPNS records

When publishing an IPNS record, you are now able to create v2 only records
by passing `--v1compat=false`. By default, we still create V1+V2 records, such
that there is the highest chance of backwards compatibility. The goal is to move
to V2 only in the future.

**TODO**: add links to IPIP https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/376

#### IPNS name resolution has been fixed

IPNS name resolution had a regression where if IPNS over PubSub was enabled, but the name was not also available via IPNS over PubSub it would take 1 minute to for the lookup to complete (if the record was not yet cached).

This has been fixed and as before will give the best record from either the DHT subsystem or IPNS over PubSub, whichever comes back first.

For details see [#9927](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9927) and [#10020](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10020).

# go-libp2p v0.29.0 update with smart dialing

We updated from [go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p) [v0.27.7](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.27.7) to [v0.29.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.29.0).  This release includes smart dialing, which is a prioritization algorithm that will try to rank addresses and protocols rather than attempting all options in parallel.  Anecdotally, we have observed [Kubo nodes make 30% less dials](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/2326#issuecomment-1644332863) with no to low latency impact.

This includes a breaking change to `ipfs id` and some of the `ipfs swarm` commands.  We no longer report `ProtocolVersion`.  This used to be hardcoded as `ipfs/0.1.0` and sent to other peers but was not providing any distinguishing value.  See [libp2p/go-libp2p#2294](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/2294) for more information.
