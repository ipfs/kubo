### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Gateway: support for `order=` and `dups=` parameters (IPIP-412)

The updated [`boxo/gateway` library](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/gateway)
introduces support for ordered CAR responses through the inclusion of optional
CAR content type parameters: `order=dfs` and `dups=y|n` from
[IPIP-412](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/412).

Previously, Kubo already provided CARs in DFS order without duplicate blocks.
With the implementation of IPIP-412, this behavior is now explicitly defined
rather than implied.

In the absence of `dups` or `order` in `Accept` request reader, the default CAR
response will have the `Content-Type: application/vnd.ipld.car; version=1; order=dfs; dups=n`
and the same blocks as Kubo 0.21.

Kubo 0.22 still only supports DFS block ordering (`order=dfs`). However, it is
now possible to request a DFS CAR stream with duplicate blocks by opting in via
`Accept: application/vnd.ipld.car; order=dfs; dups=y`. This opt-in feature can be
beneficial for memory-constrained clients and IoT devices, as it allows for
streaming large DAGs without the need to store all previously encountered
blocks in memory.

#### `ipfs name publish` now supports V2 only IPNS records

When publishing an IPNS record, you are now able to create v2 only records
by passing `--v1compat=false`. By default, we still create V1+V2 records, such
that there is the highest chance of backwards compatibility. The goal is to move
to V2 only in the future.
