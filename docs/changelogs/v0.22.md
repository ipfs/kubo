### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### `ipfs name publish` now supports V2 only IPNS records

When publishing an IPNS record, you are now able to create v2 only records
by passing `--v1compat=false`. By default, we still create V1+V2 records, such
that there is the highest chance of backwards compatibility. The goal is to move
to V2 only in the future.
