### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🚨 Improved gateway error pages with diagnostic tools

Gateway error pages now provide more actionable information during content retrieval failures. When a 504 Gateway Timeout occurs, users see detailed retrieval state information including which phase failed and a sample of providers that were attempted:

>
> - **[`Gateway.DiagnosticServiceURL`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaydiagnosticserviceurl)** (default: `https://check.ipfs.network`): Configures the diagnostic service URL. When set, 504 errors show a "Check CID retrievability" button that links to this service with `?cid=<failed-cid>` for external diagnostics. Set to empty string to disable.
> - **Enhanced error details**: Timeout errors now display the retrieval phase where failure occurred (e.g., "connecting to providers", "fetching data") and up to 3 peer IDs that were attempted but couldn't deliver the content, making it easier to diagnose network or provider issues.
> - **Retry button on all error pages**: Every gateway error page now includes a retry button for quick page refresh without manual URL re-entry.

#### 🛠️ Identity CID size enforcement and `ipfs files write` fixes

**Identity CID size limits are now enforced**

Identity CIDs use [multihash `0x00`](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L2) to embed data directly in the CID without hashing. This experimental optimization was designed for tiny data where a CID reference would be larger than the data itself, but without size limits it was easy to misuse and could turn into an anti-pattern that wastes resources and enables abuse. This release enforces a maximum of 128 bytes for identity CIDs - attempting to exceed this limit will return a clear error message.

- `ipfs add --inline-limit` and `--hash=identity` now enforce the 128-byte maximum (error when exceeded)
- `ipfs files write` prevents creation of oversized identity CIDs

**Multiple `ipfs files write` bugs have been fixed**

This release resolves several long-standing MFS issues: raw nodes now preserve their codec instead of being forced to dag-pb, append operations on raw nodes work correctly by converting to UnixFS when needed, and identity CIDs properly inherit the full CID prefix from parent directories.
