### Overview

Kubo 0.38.0 simplifies content announcement configuration, introduces an experimental sweeping DHT provider for efficient large-scale operations, and includes various performance improvements.

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🚀 Repository migration: simplified provide configuration

This release migrates the repository from version 17 to version 18, simplifying how you configure content announcements.

The old `Provider` and `Reprovider` sections are now combined into a single [`Provide`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#provide) section. Your existing settings are automatically migrated - no manual changes needed.

**Migration happens automatically** when you run `ipfs daemon --migrate`. For manual migration: `ipfs repo migrate --to=18`.

Read more about the new opt-in provide system in the [Experimental Sweeping DHT Provider](#-experimental-sweeping-dht-provider) section below.

#### 🧹 Experimental Sweeping DHT Provider

An experimental alternative to both the default DHT provider and the resource-intensive [accelerated DHT client](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingaccelerateddhtclient) is now available. When enabled via [`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedhtssweepenabled), this sweeping DHT provider explores keyspace regions systematically instead of providing keys one-by-one.

**Key benefits:**
- **Efficiency at scale**: Handles hundreds of thousands of CIDs with significantly reduced memory overhead and network connections
- **Smooth resource usage**: Spreads provide operations evenly over the reprovide interval, eliminating resource spikes
- **Better reliability**: Maintains provider state across restarts and network disruptions through persistent keystore
- **Improved observability**: Track provide success rates via the `total_provide_count` metric at the Prometheus endpoint (`/debug/metrics/prometheus`)

**Performance comparison:**
You can evaluate the effectiveness of sweep mode vs legacy mode by monitoring the `total_provide_count` metric from go-libp2p-kad-dht. This OpenTelemetry counter tracks successful provide operations, allowing you to compare provide success rates between `Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled=true` and `false` configurations.

**Note:** While this feature is experimental, some commands like `ipfs stats provide` and manual reprovide (`ipfs routing provide`) are not available. Run `ipfs provide --help` for alternative commands.

For configuration options and more details, see [`Provide.DHT`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedht) in the config documentation.

#### 🚨 Improved gateway error pages with diagnostic tools

Gateway error pages now provide more actionable information during content retrieval failures. When a 504 Gateway Timeout occurs, users see detailed retrieval state information including which phase failed and a sample of providers that were attempted:

>
> - **[`Gateway.DiagnosticServiceURL`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaydiagnosticserviceurl)** (default: `https://check.ipfs.network`): Configures the diagnostic service URL. When set, 504 errors show a "Check CID retrievability" button that links to this service with `?cid=<failed-cid>` for external diagnostics. Set to empty string to disable.
> - **Enhanced error details**: Timeout errors now display the retrieval phase where failure occurred (e.g., "connecting to providers", "fetching data") and up to 3 peer IDs that were attempted but couldn't deliver the content, making it easier to diagnose network or provider issues.
> - **Retry button on all error pages**: Every gateway error page now includes a retry button for quick page refresh without manual URL re-entry.

#### 🛠️ Identity CID size enforcement and `ipfs files write` fixes

**Identity CID size limits are now enforced**

Identity CIDs use [multihash `0x00`](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L2) to embed data directly in the CID without hashing. This experimental optimization was designed for tiny data where a CID reference would be larger than the data itself, but without size limits it was easy to misuse and could turn into an anti-pattern that wastes resources and enables abuse. This release enforces a maximum of 128 bytes for identity CIDs - attempting to exceed this limit will return a clear error message.

- `ipfs add --inline-limit` and `--hash=identity` now enforce the 128-byte maximum (error when exceeded)
- `ipfs files write` prevents creation of oversized identity CIDs

**Multiple `ipfs files write` bugs have been fixed**

This release resolves several long-standing MFS issues: raw nodes now preserve their codec instead of being forced to dag-pb, append operations on raw nodes work correctly by converting to UnixFS when needed, and identity CIDs properly inherit the full CID prefix from parent directories.
