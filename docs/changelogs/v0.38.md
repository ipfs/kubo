### Overview

Kubo 0.38.0 simplifies content announcement configuration, introduces an experimental sweeping DHT provider for efficient large-scale operations, and includes various performance improvements.

### üî¶ Highlights

#### üöÄ Repository migration: simplified provide configuration

This release migrates the repository from version 17 to version 18, simplifying how you configure content announcements.

The old `Provider` and `Reprovider` sections are now combined into a single [`Provide`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#provide) section. Your existing settings are automatically migrated - no manual changes needed.

**Migration happens automatically** when you run `ipfs daemon --migrate`. For manual migration: `ipfs repo migrate --to=18`.

Read more about the new system below.

#### üßπ Experimental Sweeping DHT Provider

A new experimental DHT provider is available as an alternative to both the default provider and the resource-intensive [accelerated DHT client](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingaccelerateddhtclient). Enable it via [`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedhtsweepenabled).

**How it works:** Instead of providing keys one-by-one, the sweep provider systematically explores DHT keyspace regions in batches.

> The diagram shows how sweep mode avoids the hourly traffic spikes of Accelerated DHT while maintaining similar effectiveness. By grouping CIDs into keyspace regions and processing them in batches, sweep mode reduces memory overhead and creates predictable network patterns.

**Benefits for large-scale operations:** Handles hundreds of thousands of CIDs with reduced memory and network connections, spreads operations evenly to eliminate resource spikes, maintains state across restarts through persistent keystore, and provides better metrics visibility.

**Monitoring and debugging:** Legacy mode (`SweepEnabled=false`) tracks `provider_reprovider_provide_count` and `provider_reprovider_reprovide_count`, while sweep mode (`SweepEnabled=true`) tracks `total_provide_count_total`. Enable debug logging with `GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL=error,provider=debug,dht/provider=debug` to see detailed logs from either system.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is experimental and opt-in. In the future, it will become the default and replace the legacy system. Some commands like `ipfs stats provide` and `ipfs routing provide` are not yet available with sweep mode. Run `ipfs provide --help` for alternatives.

For configuration details, see [`Provide.DHT`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedht). For metrics documentation, see [Provide metrics](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/metrics.md#provide).

#### üìä Exposed DHT metrics

Kubo now exposes DHT metrics from go-libp2p-kad-dht, including `total_provide_count_total` for sweep provider operations and RPC metrics prefixed with `rpc_inbound_` and `rpc_outbound_` for DHT message traffic. See [Kubo metrics documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/metrics.md) for details.

#### üö® Improved gateway error pages with diagnostic tools

Gateway error pages now provide more actionable information during content retrieval failures. When a 504 Gateway Timeout occurs, users see detailed retrieval state information including which phase failed and a sample of providers that were attempted:

> ![Improved gateway error page showing retrieval diagnostics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18432c74-a5e0-4bbf-9815-7c780779dc98)
>
> - **[`Gateway.DiagnosticServiceURL`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaydiagnosticserviceurl)** (default: `https://check.ipfs.network`): Configures the diagnostic service URL. When set, 504 errors show a "Check CID retrievability" button that links to this service with `?cid=<failed-cid>` for external diagnostics. Set to empty string to disable.
> - **Enhanced error details**: Timeout errors now display the retrieval phase where failure occurred (e.g., "connecting to providers", "fetching data") and up to 3 peer IDs that were attempted but couldn't deliver the content, making it easier to diagnose network or provider issues.
> - **Retry button on all error pages**: Every gateway error page now includes a retry button for quick page refresh without manual URL re-entry.

#### üé® Updated WebUI

The Web UI has been updated to [v4.9.0](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/releases/tag/v4.9.0) with a new **Diagnostics** screen for troubleshooting and system monitoring. Access it at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui` when running your local IPFS node.

Additional improvements include a close button in the file viewer, better error handling, and fixed navigation highlighting.

#### üìå Pin name improvements

`ipfs pin ls <cid> --names` now correctly returns pin names for specific CIDs ([#10649](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/10649), [boxo#1035](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/1035)), and RPC no longer incorrectly returns names from other pins ([#10966](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10966)).

#### üõ†Ô∏è Identity CID size enforcement and `ipfs files write` fixes

**Identity CID size limits are now enforced**

Identity CIDs use [multihash `0x00`](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L2) to embed data directly in the CID without hashing. This experimental optimization was designed for tiny data where a CID reference would be larger than the data itself, but without size limits it was easy to misuse and could turn into an anti-pattern that wastes resources and enables abuse. This release enforces a maximum of 128 bytes for identity CIDs - attempting to exceed this limit will return a clear error message.

- `ipfs add --inline-limit` and `--hash=identity` now enforce the 128-byte maximum (error when exceeded)
- `ipfs files write` prevents creation of oversized identity CIDs

**Multiple `ipfs files write` bugs have been fixed**

This release resolves several long-standing MFS issues: raw nodes now preserve their codec instead of being forced to dag-pb, append operations on raw nodes work correctly by converting to UnixFS when needed, and identity CIDs properly inherit the full CID prefix from parent directories.

#### MFS directory cache auto-flush

The new [`Internal.MFSAutoflushThreshold`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#internalmfsautoflushthreshold) configuration option prevents unbounded memory growth when using `--flush=false` with `ipfs files` commands by automatically flushing directories when their cache exceeds the configured threshold (default: 256 entries).
