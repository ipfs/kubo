### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🛠️ Identity CID size enforcement and `ipfs files write` fixes

**Identity CID size limits are now enforced**

Identity CIDs use [multihash `0x00`](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L2) to embed data directly in the CID without hashing, which is useful for tiny data where a CID reference would be larger than the data itself. However, without size limits these could waste resources and enable abuse. This release enforces a maximum of 128 bytes for identity CIDs - attempting to exceed this limit will trigger an automatic switch to cryptographic hashing or return a clear error message.

- `ipfs add --inline-limit` now enforces the 128-byte maximum
- `ipfs add --hash=identity` automatically switches to SHA-256 when data exceeds the limit
- `ipfs files write` prevents creation of oversized identity CIDs

**Multiple `ipfs files write` bugs have been fixed**

This release resolves several long-standing MFS issues: raw nodes now preserve their codec instead of being forced to dag-pb, append operations on raw nodes work correctly by converting to UnixFS when needed, and identity CIDs properly inherit the full CID prefix from parent directories.
