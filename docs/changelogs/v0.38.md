### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🚨 Improved gateway error pages with diagnostic tools

Gateway error pages now provide more actionable information during content retrieval failures. When a 504 Gateway Timeout occurs, users see detailed retrieval state information including which phase failed and a sample of providers that were attempted:

> - **[`Gateway.DiagnosticServiceURL`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaydiagnosticserviceurl)** (default: `https://check.ipfs.network`): Configures the diagnostic service URL. When set, 504 errors show a "Check CID retrievability" button that links to this service with `?cid=<failed-cid>` for external diagnostics. Set to empty string to disable.
> - **Enhanced error details**: Timeout errors now display the retrieval phase where failure occurred (e.g., "connecting to providers", "fetching data") and up to 3 peer IDs that were attempted but couldn't deliver the content, making it easier to diagnose network or provider issues.
> - **Retry button on all error pages**: Every gateway error page now includes a retry button for quick page refresh without manual URL re-entry.
