### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🎯 AutoTLS: Automatic Certificates for libp2p WebSockets via `libp2p.direct`

This release introduces an experimental feature that significantly improves how browsers can connect to Kubo node.
Opt-in configuration allows Kubo nodes to obtain CA-signed TLS certificates for [libp2p Secure WebSocket (WSS)](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/websockets/README.md) connections automatically.

See [`AutoTLS`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autotls) configuration for details how to enable it. We appreciate you testing and providing an early feedback in [kubo#10560](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/10560).
