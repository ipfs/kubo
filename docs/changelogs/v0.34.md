### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### AutoTLS now enabled by default for nodes with 1 hour uptime

Starting now, any publicly dialable Kubo node with a `/tcp` listener that remains online for at least one hour will receive a TLS certificate through the [`AutoTLS`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autotls) feature.
This occurs automatically, with no need for manual setup.

To bypass the 1-hour delay and enable AutoTLS immediately, users can explicitly opt-in by running the following commands:

```console
$ ipfs config --json AutoTLS.Enabled true
$ ipfs config --json AutoTLS.RegistrationDelay 0
```

AutoTLS will remain disabled under the following conditions:

- The node already has a manually configured `/ws` (WebSocket) listener
- A private network is in use with a `swarm.key`
- TCP or WebSocket transports are disabled, or there is no `/tcp` listener

To troubleshoot, use `GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL="error,autotls=info`.

For more details, check out the [`AutoTLS` configuration documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autotls) or dive deeper with [AutoTLS libp2p blog post](https://blog.libp2p.io/autotls/).

#### RPC and CLI command changes

- `ipfs config` is now validating json fields ([#10679](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10679)).
- Deprecated the `bitswap reprovide` command. Make sure to switch to modern `routing reprovide`. ([#10677](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10677))
- The `stats reprovide` command now shows additional stats for [`Routing.AcceleratedDHTClient`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingaccelerateddhtclient), indicating the last and next `reprovide` times. ([#10677](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10677))

#### Bitswap improvements from Boxo

This release includes performance and reliability improvements and fixes for minor resource leaks. One of the performance changes [greatly improves the bitswap clients ability to operate under high load](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/817#pullrequestreview-2587207745), that could previously result in an out of memory condition.

#### `IPFS_LOG_LEVEL` deprecated

The variable has been deprecated. Please use [`GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md#golog_log_level) instead for configuring logging levels.

#### Pebble datastore format update

If the pebble database format is not explicitly set in the config, then automatically upgrade it to the latest format version supported by the release ob pebble used by kubo. This will ensure that the database format is sufficiently up-to-date to be compatible with a major version upgrade of pebble. This is necessary before upgrading to use pebble v2.

#### Badger datastore update

An update was made to the badger v1 datastore that avoids use of mmap in 32-bit environments, which has been seen to cause issues on some platforms. Please be aware that this could lead to a performance regression for users of badger in a 32-bit environment. Badger users are advised to move to the flatds or pebble datastore.
