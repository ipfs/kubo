### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### JSON config validation

`ipfs config` is now validating json fields ([#10679](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10679)).

#### Reprovide command moved to routing

Moved the `bitswap reprovide` command to `routing reprovide`. ([#10677](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10677))

#### Additional stats for Accelerated DHT Reprovides

The `stats reprovide` command now shows additional stats for the DHT Accelerated Client, indicating the last and next `reprovide` times. ([#10677](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10677))

#### Bitswap improvements from Boxo

This release includes performance and reliability improvements and fixes for minro resource leaks. One of the performance changes greatly improves the bitswap clients ability to operate under high load, that could previously result in an out of memory condition.

### 📝 Changelog
