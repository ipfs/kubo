### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### JSON config validation

`ipfs config` is now validating json fields ([#10679](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10679)).

#### Reprovide command moved to routing

Moved the `bitswap reprovide` command to `routing reprovide`. ([#10677](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10677))

#### Additional stats for Accelerated DHT Reprovides

The `stats reprovide` command now shows additional stats for the DHT Accelerated Client, indicating the last and next `reprovide` times. ([#10677](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10677))

#### Bitswap improvements from Boxo

This release includes performance and reliability improvements and fixes for minor resource leaks. One of the performance changes [greatly improves the bitswap clients ability to operate under high load](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/817#pullrequestreview-2587207745), that could previously result in an out of memory condition.
