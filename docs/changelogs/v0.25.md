### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### RPC `API.Authorizations`

Kubo RPC API now supports optional HTTP Authorization.

Granular control over user access to the RPC can be defined in the
[`API.Authorizations`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#apiauthorizations)
map in the configuration file, allowing different users or apps to have unique
access secrets and allowed paths.

This feature is opt-in. By default, no authorization is set up.
For configuration instructions,
refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#apiauthorizations).

#### Graphsync Experiment Removal

Currently the Graphsync server is to our knowledge not used
due to lack of compatible software.
And we are left to have to maintain the go-graphsync implementation when trying
to update Kubo because some dependency changed and it fails to build anymore.

For more information see https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9747.
