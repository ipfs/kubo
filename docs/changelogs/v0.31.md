### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Experimental Pebble Datastore

[Pebble](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#pebbleds-profile) provides a high-performance alternative to leveldb as the datastore, and provides a modern replacement for [legacy badgerv1](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#badgerds-profile).

Unlike Badger, Pebble:
- Does not need GC cycles and does not use more space than necessary
- Does not take several minutes to start with large repositories
- Performs well even with default settings

A fresh Kubo node can be initialized with [`pebbleds` profile](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#pebbleds-profile) via `ipfs init --profile pebbleds`.

There are a number of parameters available for tuning pebble's performance to your specific needs. Default values are used for any parameters that are not configured or are set to their zero-value.
For a description of the available tuning parameters, see [kubo/docs/datastores.md#pebbleds](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/datastores.md#pebbleds).

#### New metrics

- Added 3 new go metrics: `go_gc_gogc_percent`, `go_gc_gomemlimit_bytes` and `go_sched_gomaxprocs_threads` as those are [recommended by the Go team](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/1559)
- Added [network usage metrics](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/1555): `process_network_receive_bytes_total` and `process_network_transmit_bytes_total`
- Removed `go_memstat_lookups_total` metric [which was always 0](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/1577)

#### `lowpower` profile no longer breaks DHT announcements

We've notices users were applying `lowpower` profile, and then reporting content routing issues. This was because `lowpower` disabled reprovider system and locally hosted data was no longer announced on Amino DHT.

This release changes [`lowpower` profile](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#lowpower-profile) to not change reprovider settings, ensuring the new users are not sabotaging themselves. It also adds [`annouce-on`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#announce-on-profile) and [`announce-off`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#announce-off-profile) profiles for controlling announcement settings separately.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've ever applied the `lowpower` profile before, there is a high chance your node is not announcing to DHT anymore.
> If you have `Reprovider.Interval` set to `0` you may want to wet it to `22h` (or run `ipfs config profile apply announce-on`) to fix your system.
>
> As a convenience, `ipfs daemon` will warn if reprovide system is disabled, creating oportinity to fix configuration if it was not intentional.
