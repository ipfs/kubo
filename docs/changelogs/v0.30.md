### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### WebRTC-Direct Transport enabled by default

Kubo now ships with `/udp/4001/webrtc-direct` listener enabled by default.

WebRTC Direct complements existing `/wss` (Secure WebSockets) and `/webtransport` transports. Unlike `/wss`, which requires a domain name and a CA-issued TLS certificate, WebRTC Direct works with IPs and can be enabled by default on all Kubo nodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Kubo 0.30 includes a migration for existing users that adds `/webrtc-direct` listener on the same UDP port as `/udp/{port}/quic-v1`. This supports the WebRTC-Direct rollout by reusing preexisting UDP firewall settings and port mappings created for QUIC.

#### AutoNAT V2 Service Introduced Alongside V1

The AutoNAT service enables nodes to determine their public reachability on the internet. AutoNAT V2 enhances this protocol with improved features. In this release, Kubo will offer both V1 and V2 services to other peers, although it will continue to use only V1 when acting as a client. Future releases will phase out V1, transitioning clients to utilize V2 exclusively.

For more details, see the [Deployment Plan for AutoNAT V2](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/10091) and [`AutoNAT`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autonat) configuration options.

#### Automated `ipfs version check`

Kubo now performs privacy-preserving version checks using the [libp2p identify protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md) on peers detected by the Amino DHT client.
If more than 5% of Kubo peers seen by your node are running a newer version, you will receive a log message notification.

- For manual checks, refer to `ipfs version check --help` for details.
- To disable automated checks, set [`Version.SwarmCheckEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#versionswarmcheckenabled) to `false`.

#### Version Suffix Configuration

Defining the optional agent version suffix is now simpler. The [`Version.AgentSuffix`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#agentsuffix) value from the Kubo config takes precedence over any value provided via `ipfs daemon --agent-version-suffix` (which is still supported).

> [!NOTE]
> Setting a custom version suffix helps with ecosystem analysis, such as Amino DHT reports published at https://stats.ipfs.network
