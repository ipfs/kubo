### Overview

#### RPC client: removed deprecated DHT API

The deprecated DHT API commands in the RPC client have been removed. Instead, use the Routing API.

#### Gateway: `/api/v0` is removed

The legacy subset of the Kubo RPC that was available via the Gateway port and was deprecated is now completely removed. You can read more in <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/10312>.

If you have a legacy software that relies on this behavior, and want to expose parts of `/api/v0` next to `/ipfs`, use reverse-proxy in front of Kubo to mount both Gateway and RPC on the same port. NOTE: exposing RPC to the internet comes with security risk: make sure to specify access control via [API.Authorizations](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#apiauthorizations).
