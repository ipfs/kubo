### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🧹 Experimental Sweeping DHT Provider

An experimental alternative to both the default DHT provider and the resource-intensive [accelerated DHT client](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingaccelerateddhtclient) is now available. When enabled via [`Reprovider.Sweep.Enabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reprovidersweep), this sweeping DHT provider explores keyspace regions instead of providing keys one-by-one.

This aims to help both large and small storage providers efficiently advertise hundreds of thousands of CIDs by batching operations and spreading work evenly over time.

**Note:** While this feature is experimental, some commands like `ipfs stats provide` and manual reprovide (`ipfs routing provide`) are not available. Run `ipfs provide --help` for alternative commands.

For configuration options and more details, see [`Reprovider.Sweep`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reprovidersweep) in the config documentation.
