### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Clear provide queue when reprovide strategy changes

Your content sharing strategy changes now take effect cleanly, without interference from previously queued items.

When you change [`Reprovider.Strategy`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reproviderstrategy) and restart Kubo, the provide queue is automatically cleared. This ensures only content matching your new strategy will be announced to the network.

A new `ipfs provide clear` command also allows manual queue clearing for debugging purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading to Kubo 0.37 will automatically clear any preexisting provide queue. The next time `Reprovider.Interval` hits, `Reprovider.Strategy` will be executed on a clean slate, ensuring consistent behavior with your current configuration.

#### New log level querying capabilities

The `ipfs log level` command has been enhanced to support querying current logging levels while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing scripts and workflows.

**Getting log levels (new functionality):**
- `ipfs log level` - Shows default level only
- `ipfs log level '*'` - Shows log level for every subsystem, including default level
- `ipfs log level foo` - Shows log level for a specific subsystem only
- Kubo RPC API: `POST /api/v0/log/level?arg=<subsystem>`

**Setting log levels (existing functionality unchanged):**
- `ipfs log level foo debug` - Sets "foo" subsystem to "debug" level
- `ipfs log level '*' info` - Sets all subsystems to "info" level
- `ipfs log level foo default` - Sets "foo" subsystem to current default level

This enhancement provides full visibility into your current logging configuration without breaking any existing usage patterns.

#### 🧷 Named pins in `ipfs add` command

Added `--pin-name` flag to `ipfs add` for assigning names to pins.

```console
$ ipfs add --pin-name=testname cat.jpg
added bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi cat.jpg

$ ipfs pin ls --names
bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi recursive testname
```

#### Removed unnecessary dependencies

Kubo has been cleaned up by removing unnecessary dependencies and packages:

- Removed `thirdparty/assert` (replaced by `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`)
- Removed `thirdparty/dir` (replaced by `misc/fsutil`)
- Removed `thirdparty/notifier` (unused)
- Removed `goprocess` dependency (replaced with native Go `context` patterns)

These changes reduce the dependency footprint while improving code maintainability and following Go best practices.

#### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `go-libp2p` to [v0.42.1](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.42.1)
- update `p2p-forge/client` to [v0.6.1](https://github.com/ipshipyard/p2p-forge/releases/tag/v0.6.1)
- update `boxo` to [v0.33.1](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.33.1)
