### Overview

### üî¶ Highlights

#### Clear provide queue when reprovide strategy changes

Your content sharing strategy changes now take effect cleanly, without interference from previously queued items.

When you change [`Reprovider.Strategy`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reproviderstrategy) and restart Kubo, the provide queue is automatically cleared. This ensures only content matching your new strategy will be announced to the network.

A new `ipfs provide clear` command also allows manual queue clearing for debugging purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading to Kubo 0.37 will automatically clear any preexisting provide queue. The next time `Reprovider.Interval` hits, `Reprovider.Strategy` will be executed on a clean slate, ensuring consistent behavior with your current configuration.

#### Remove unnecessary packages from thirdparty

Removed unnecessary packages from the `thirdparty` area of kubo repositroy.

- Removed `thirdparty/assert` (replaced by `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`)
- Removed `thirdparty/dir` (replaced by `misc/fsutil)`
- Removed `thirdparty/notifier` (unused)

#### AutoConfig for automatic network configuration

Your IPFS node can now automatically fetch network defaults like bootstrap peers and DNS resolvers from a remote service. This means you'll always have up-to-date settings without manual configuration updates.

- New installs automatically use `Bootstrap: ["auto"]` instead of hardcoded addresses
- Existing nodes are migrated to use AutoConfig during upgrade to v0.37
- Configure with `ipfs config AutoConfig.URL` or disable with `ipfs config AutoConfig.Enabled false`
- See [AutoConfig documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autoconfig) for details

#### Cleaner bootstrap commands

Bootstrap commands are now more intuitive and the deprecated `--default` flag has been removed.

- Use `ipfs bootstrap add default` or the new `ipfs bootstrap add auto` (both do the same thing)
- The old `ipfs bootstrap add --default` no longer works - update your scripts!
- Commands now require AutoConfig to be enabled when adding default peers
- Hardcoded `DefaultBootstrapAddresses` removed from code - use AutoConfig or set `AutoConfig.Enabled=false` and manage your own list by hand, like you did before

#### Faster migrations with embedded tooling

Repository migrations now run instantly without downloading external tools. Starting with repo version 17, all migration code is built into Kubo itself.

- Migrations run immediately when you start the daemon - no more waiting for downloads
- Better reliability - no network issues or missing migration tools
- Use `ipfs repo migrate --to=16 --allow-downgrade` to go back to older versions if needed
- External migrations still work for older repo versions (before v17)

#### üì¶Ô∏è Important dependency updates

- update `boxo` to [v0.34.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.34.0)
