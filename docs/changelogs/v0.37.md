### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Clear provide queue when reprovide strategy changes

Your content sharing strategy changes now take effect cleanly, without interference from previously queued items.

When you change [`Reprovider.Strategy`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#reproviderstrategy) and restart Kubo, the provide queue is automatically cleared. This ensures only content matching your new strategy will be announced to the network.

A new `ipfs provide clear` command also allows manual queue clearing for debugging purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading to Kubo 0.37 will automatically clear any preexisting provide queue. The next time `Reprovider.Interval` hits, `Reprovider.Strategy` will be executed on a clean slate, ensuring consistent behavior with your current configuration.

#### Remove unnecessary packages from thirdparty

Removed unnecessary packages from the `thirdparty` area of kubo repositroy.

- Removed `thirdparty/assert` (replaced by `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`)
- Removed `thirdparty/dir` (replaced by `misc/fsutil)`
- Removed `thirdparty/notifier` (unused)

#### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `boxo` to [v0.34.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.34.0)
