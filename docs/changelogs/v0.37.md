### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Clear Provide Queue
    
On restart, if the currently configured reprovide strategy does not match the previous strategy read from the datastore, then clear the provide queue and update the reprovide strategy that is stored in the datastore.

> [!NOTE]
> Any CIDs queued at shutdown won’t be provided until the next reprovide ([`Reprovider.Interval`](../config.md#reproviderinterval) after restart), even if they match the new reprovide strategy.

#### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `boxo` to [v0.34.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.34.0)
