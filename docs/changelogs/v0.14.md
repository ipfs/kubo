### 🛠 BREAKING CHANGES

#### Removed `mdns_legacy` implementation

The modern DNS-SD compatible [zeroconf implementation](https://github.com/libp2p/zeroconf#readme)
(based on [this specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/discovery/mdns.md))
has been running next to the `mdns_legacy` for a while (since v0.11). During
this transitional period Kubo nodes were sending twice as many LAN packets,
which ends with this release: we've [removed](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9048) the legacy implementation.

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🛣️ Delegated Routing

Content routing is the a term used to describe the problem of finding providers for a given piece of content.
If you have a hash, or CID of some data, how do you find who has it?
In IPFS, until now, only a DHT was used as a decentralized answer to content routing.
Now, content routing can be handled by clients implementing the [Reframe protocol](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/reframe#readme).

Example configuration usage using the [Filecoin Network Indexer](https://docs.cid.contact/filecoin-network-indexer/overview):

```
ipfs config Routing.Routers.CidContact --json '{
  "Type": "reframe",
  "Parameters": {
    "Endpoint": "https://cid.contact/reframe"
  }
}'

```

#### 👥 Rename to Kubo

We've renamed Go-IPFS to Kubo ([details](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/8959)).

Published artifacts use `kubo` now, and are available at:

- https://dist.ipfs.io/kubo/
- https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/

To minimize the impact on infrastructure that autoupdates on a new release,
the same binaries are still published under the old name at:

- https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/
- https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs/
