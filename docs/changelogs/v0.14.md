### 🛠 BREAKING CHANGES

#### Removed `mdns_legacy` implementation

The modern DNS-SD compatible [zeroconf implementation](https://github.com/libp2p/zeroconf#readme)
(based on [this specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/discovery/mdns.md))
has been running next to the `mdns_legacy` for a while (since v0.11). During
this transitional period Kubo nodes were sending twice as many LAN packets,
which ends with this release: we've [removed](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9048) the legacy implementation.

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🛣️ Delegated Routing

Content routing is the a term used to describe the problem of finding providers for a given piece of content.
If you have a hash, or CID of some data, how do you find who has it?
In IPFS, until now, only a DHT was used as a decentralized answer to content routing.
Now, content routing can be handled by clients implementing the [Reframe protocol](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/reframe#readme).

Example configuration usage using the [Filecoin Network Indexer](https://docs.cid.contact/filecoin-network-indexer/overview):

```
ipfs config Routing.Routers.CidContact --json '{
  "Type": "reframe",
  "Parameters": {
    "Endpoint": "https://cid.contact/reframe"
  }
}'

```

Anyone can create and run their own reframe endpoint, and experiment with custom routing logic. See [`someguy`](https://github.com/aschmahmann/someguy) example, which proxies requests to BOTH the IPFS Public DHT AND an Indexer node.

#### 👥 Rename to Kubo

We've renamed Go-IPFS to Kubo ([details](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/8959)).

Published artifacts use `kubo` now, and are available at:

- https://dist.ipfs.io/kubo/
- https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/

To minimize the impact on infrastructure that autoupdates on a new release,
the same binaries are still published under the old name at:

- https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/
- https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs/

The libp2p [`identify`](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/protocols/#identify)  [`agentVersion`](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md#agentversion) of Kubo has also been changed from `go-ipfs` to `kubo`.

#### 🎒 `ipfs repo migrate`

This new command allows the you to run the repo migration without starting the daemon.

See `ipfs repo migrate --help` for more info.

#### 🚀 Emoji support in Multibase

Kubo now supports [`base256emoji`](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/rfcs/Base256Emoji.md) encoding in all [Multibase](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/glossary/#multibase) contexts. Use it for testing Unicode support, as visual aid while explaining Multiformats, or just for fun:

```console
$ echo -n "test" | ipfs multibase encode -b base256emoji  -
🚀😈✋🌈😈

$ echo -n "🚀😈✋🌈😈" | ipfs multibase decode -
test

$ ipfs cid format -v 1 -b base256emoji bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi
