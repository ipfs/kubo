### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Mplex removal

Support for Mplex was removed, this is because it is unreliable and would
randomly drop streams when sending data too fast.

New pieces of code rely on backpressure, that means the stream will dynamicaly
slow down the sending rate if data is getting backed up.
Backpressure is provided by Yamux and QUIC.
