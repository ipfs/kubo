### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Mplex removal

[Support for Mplex was removed from Kubo and go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/553). It was unreliable and known to
randomly drop streams when sending data too fast.

New pieces of code rely on backpressure, that means the stream will dynamicaly
slow down the sending rate if data is getting backed up.
Backpressure is now provided by [Yamux](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmtransportsmultiplexersyamux) (enabled by default) and QUIC.

#### Gateway: meaningful CAR responses on Not Found errors

When requesting a CAR from the gateway, the root of the CAR might no longer be
meaningful. By default, the CAR root will be the last resolvable segment of the
path. However, in situations where the path cannot be resolved, such as when
the path does not exist, a CAR will be sent with a root of `bafkqaaa` (empty CID).

This CAR will contain all blocks necessary to validate that the path does not
exist without having to trust the gateway.

#### Binary characters in file names: no longer works with old clients and new Kubo servers

In this version, we updated Kubo to support Go 1.20+. In Go 1.20, a regression
regarding multipart headers was [introduced](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/60674).
This only affects `ipfs add` when a file name has binary characters in its name.
As a consequence, we had to update the encoding of the file name headers. This is
the compatibility table:

|            | New Client | Old Client  |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| New Server | ✅         | 🟡*         |
| Old Server | ✅         | ✅          |

*Old clients can only send Unicode file paths to the server.
