### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Mplex deprecation

Mplex is being deprecated, this is because it is unreliable and
randomly drop streams when sending data *too fast*.

New pieces of code rely on backpressure, that means the stream will dynamicaly
slow down the sending rate if data is getting backed up.
Backpressure is provided by **Yamux** and **QUIC**.

In case you need compatibility with older implementations that do not ship with
Yamux (like default's JS-IPFS) you can turned it back ON in the config with:
```console
$ ipfs config --json Swarm.Transports.Multiplexers.Mplex 200
```

We will completely remove Mplex in v0.24 as it makes protocols very bad to implement,
if you are in this situation you need to add yamux support to your other implementation.
