### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Provider resume cycle for improved reproviding reliability

When using the sweeping provider (`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled`), Kubo now
persists the reprovide cycle state and automatically resumes where it left off
after a restart. This brings several improvements:

- **Persistent progress**: The provider now saves its position in the reprovide
cycle to the datastore. On restart, it continues from where it stopped instead
of starting from scratch.
- **Catch-up reproviding**: If the node was offline for an extended period, all
CIDs that haven't been reprovided within the configured reprovide interval are
immediately queued for reproviding when the node starts up. This ensures
content availability is maintained even after downtime.
- **Persistent provide queue**: The provide queue is now persisted to the
datastore on shutdown. When the node restarts, queued CIDs are restored and
provided as expected, preventing loss of pending provide operations.
- **Resume control**: The resume behavior is now controlled via the
`Provide.DHT.ResumeEnabled` config option (default: `true`). If you don't want
to keep the persisted provider state from a previous run, you can set
`Provide.DHT.ResumeEnabled=false` in your config.

This feature significantly improves the reliability of content providing,
especially for nodes that experience intermittent connectivity or restarts.

#### 🪦 Deprecated `go-ipfs` name no longer published

The `go-ipfs` name was deprecated in 2022 and renamed to `kubo`. Starting with this release, we have stopped publishing Docker images and distribution binaries under the old `go-ipfs` name.

Existing users should switch to:

- Docker: `ipfs/kubo` image (instead of `ipfs/go-ipfs`)
- Binaries: download from <https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/> or <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases>

For Docker users, the legacy `ipfs/go-ipfs` image name now shows a deprecation notice directing you to `ipfs/kubo`.

### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `go-ds-pebble` to [v0.5.3](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-pebble/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
