### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🪦 Deprecated `go-ipfs` name no longer published

The `go-ipfs` name was deprecated in 2022 and renamed to `kubo`. Starting with this release, we have stopped publishing Docker images and distribution binaries under the old `go-ipfs` name.

Existing users should switch to:
- Docker: `ipfs/kubo` image (instead of `ipfs/go-ipfs`)
- Binaries: download from https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/ or https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases

For Docker users, the legacy `ipfs/go-ipfs` image name now shows a deprecation notice directing you to `ipfs/kubo`.

#### Routing V1 HTTP API now exposed by default

The [Routing V1 HTTP API](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) is now exposed by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/routing/v1`. This allows light clients in browsers to use Kubo Gateway as a delegated routing backend instead of running a full DHT client. Support for [IPIP-476: Delegated Routing DHT Closest Peers API](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476) is included. Can be disabled via [`Gateway.ExposeRoutingAPI`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewayexposeroutingapi).

### 📦️ Important dependency updates
