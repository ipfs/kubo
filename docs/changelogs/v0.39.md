### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 📊 Detailed statistics for Sweep provider with `ipfs provide stat`

The experimental Sweep provider system ([introduced in
v0.38](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.38.md#-experimental-sweeping-dht-provider))
now has detailed statistics available through `ipfs provide stat`.

**Default behavior:** Displays a brief summary showing queue sizes, scheduled
CIDs/regions, average record holders, ongoing/total provides, and worker status
when resources are constrained.

**Detailed statistics with `--all`:** View complete metrics organized into sections:

- **Connectivity**: DHT connection status
- **Queues**: Pending provide and reprovide operations
- **Schedule**: CIDs/regions scheduled for reprovide
- **Timings**: Uptime, reprovide cycle information
- **Network**: Peer statistics, keyspace region sizes
- **Operations**: Ongoing and past provides, rates, errors
- **Workers**: Worker pool utilization and availability

**Flexible monitoring:** Individual sections can be displayed using flags like
`--network`, `--operations`, or `--workers`. Multiple flags can be combined for
custom views. The `--compact` flag provides a 2-column layout ideal for
continuous monitoring with `watch ipfs provide stat --all --compact`.

**Dual DHT support:** For Dual DHT configurations, use `--lan` to view LAN DHT
provider statistics instead of the default WAN DHT stats.

> [!NOTE]
> These statistics are only available when using the Sweep provider system
> (enabled via
> [`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedhtsweepenabled)).
> Legacy provider shows basic statistics without flag support.

#### 🪦 Deprecated `go-ipfs` name no longer published

The `go-ipfs` name was deprecated in 2022 and renamed to `kubo`. Starting with this release, we have stopped publishing Docker images and distribution binaries under the old `go-ipfs` name.

Existing users should switch to:

- Docker: `ipfs/kubo` image (instead of `ipfs/go-ipfs`)
- Binaries: download from <https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/> or <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases>

For Docker users, the legacy `ipfs/go-ipfs` image name now shows a deprecation notice directing you to `ipfs/kubo`.

### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `go-ds-pebble` to [v0.5.3](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-pebble/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
