### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 📊 Detailed statistics for Sweep provider with `ipfs provide stat`

The experimental Sweep provider system ([introduced in
v0.38](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.38.md#-experimental-sweeping-dht-provider))
now has detailed statistics available through `ipfs provide stat`.

These statistics help you monitor provider health and troubleshoot issues,
especially useful for nodes providing large content collections. You can quickly
identify bottlenecks like queue backlog, worker saturation, or connectivity
problems that might prevent content from being announced to the DHT.

**Default behavior:** Displays a brief summary showing queue sizes, scheduled
CIDs/regions, average record holders, ongoing/total provides, and worker status
when resources are constrained.

**Detailed statistics with `--all`:** View complete metrics organized into sections:

- **Connectivity**: DHT connection status
- **Queues**: Pending provide and reprovide operations
- **Schedule**: CIDs/regions scheduled for reprovide
- **Timings**: Uptime, reprovide cycle information
- **Network**: Peer statistics, keyspace region sizes
- **Operations**: Ongoing and past provides, rates, errors
- **Workers**: Worker pool utilization and availability

**Real-time monitoring:** For continuous monitoring, run
`watch ipfs provide stat --all --compact` to see detailed statistics refreshed
in a 2-column layout. This lets you observe provide rates, queue sizes, and
worker availability in real-time. Individual sections can be displayed using
flags like `--network`, `--operations`, or `--workers`, and multiple flags can
be combined for custom views.

**Dual DHT support:** For Dual DHT configurations, use `--lan` to view LAN DHT
provider statistics instead of the default WAN DHT stats.

> [!NOTE]
> These statistics are only available when using the Sweep provider system
> (enabled via
> [`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedhtsweepenabled)).
> Legacy provider shows basic statistics without flag support.

#### 🪦 Deprecated `go-ipfs` name no longer published

The `go-ipfs` name was deprecated in 2022 and renamed to `kubo`. Starting with this release, we have stopped publishing Docker images and distribution binaries under the old `go-ipfs` name.

Existing users should switch to:

- Docker: `ipfs/kubo` image (instead of `ipfs/go-ipfs`)
- Binaries: download from <https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/> or <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases>

For Docker users, the legacy `ipfs/go-ipfs` image name now shows a deprecation notice directing you to `ipfs/kubo`.

### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `go-ds-pebble` to [v0.5.3](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-pebble/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
