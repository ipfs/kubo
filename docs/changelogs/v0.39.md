### Overview

Kubo 0.39 makes self-hosting practical on consumer hardware and home networks. The DHT sweep provider (now default) announces your content to the network without traffic spikes that overwhelm residential connections. Automatic UPnP recovery means your node stays reachable after router restarts without manual intervention.

New content becomes findable immediately after `ipfs add`. The provider system persists state across restarts, alerts you when falling behind, and exposes detailed stats for monitoring. This release also finalizes the deprecation of the legacy `go-ipfs` name.

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🎯 DHT Sweep provider is now the default

The Amino DHT Sweep provider system, introduced as experimental in v0.38, is now enabled by default (`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled=true`).

**What this means:** All nodes now benefit from efficient keyspace-sweeping content announcements that reduce memory overhead and create predictable network patterns, especially for nodes providing large content collections.

**Migration:** The transition is automatic on upgrade. Your existing configuration is preserved:

- If you explicitly set `Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled=false` in v0.38, you'll continue using the legacy provider
- If you were using the default settings, you'll automatically get the sweep provider
- To opt out and return to legacy behavior: `ipfs config --json Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled false`
- Providers with medium to large datasets may need to adjust defaults; see [Capacity Planning](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/provide-stats.md#capacity-planning)
- When `Routing.AcceleratedDHTClient` is enabled, full sweep efficiency may not be available yet; consider disabling the accelerated client as sweep is sufficient for most workloads. See [caveat 4](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingaccelerateddhtclient).

**New features available with sweep mode:**

- Detailed statistics via `ipfs provide stat` ([see below](#-detailed-statistics-with-ipfs-provide-stat))
- Automatic resume after restarts with persistent state ([see below](#️-provider-state-persists-across-restarts))
- Proactive alerts when reproviding falls behind ([see below](#-slow-reprovide-warnings))
- Better metrics for monitoring (`provider_provides_total`) ([see below](#-metric-rename-provider_provides_total))
- Fast optimistic provide of new root CIDs ([see below](#-fast-root-cid-providing-for-immediate-content-discovery))

For background on the sweep provider design and motivations, see [`Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedhtsweepenabled) and Shipyard's blogpost [Provide Sweep: Solving the DHT Provide Bottleneck](https://ipshipyard.com/blog/2025-dht-provide-sweep/).

#### ⚡ Fast root CID providing for immediate content discovery

When you add content to IPFS, the sweep provider queues it for efficient DHT provides over time. While this is resource-efficient, other peers won't find your content immediately after `ipfs add` or `ipfs dag import` completes.

To make sharing faster, `ipfs add` and `ipfs dag import` now do an immediate provide of root CIDs to the DHT in addition to the regular queue (controlled by the new `--fast-provide-root` flag, enabled by default). This complements the sweep provider system: fast-provide handles the urgent case (root CIDs that users share and reference), while the sweep provider efficiently provides all blocks according to `Provide.Strategy` over time.

This closes the gap between command completion and content shareability: root CIDs typically become discoverable on the network in under a second (compared to 30+ seconds previously). The feature uses optimistic DHT operations, which are significantly faster with the sweep provider (now enabled by default).

By default, this immediate provide runs in the background without blocking the command. For use cases requiring guaranteed discoverability before the command returns (e.g., sharing a link immediately), use `--fast-provide-wait` to block until the provide completes.

**Simple examples:**

```bash
ipfs add file.txt                     # Root provided immediately, blocks queued for sweep provider
ipfs add file.txt --fast-provide-wait # Wait for root provide to complete
ipfs dag import file.car              # Same for CAR imports
```

**Configuration:** Set defaults via `Import.FastProvideRoot` (default: `true`) and `Import.FastProvideWait` (default: `false`). See `ipfs add --help` and `ipfs dag import --help` for more details and examples.

Fast root CID provide is automatically skipped when DHT routing is unavailable (e.g., `Routing.Type=none` or delegated-only configurations).

#### ⏯️ Provider state persists across restarts

The Sweep provider now persists the reprovide cycle state and automatically resumes where it left off after a restart. This brings several improvements:

- **Persistent progress**: The provider saves its position in the reprovide cycle to the datastore. On restart, it continues from where it stopped instead of starting from scratch.
- **Catch-up reproviding**: If the node was offline for an extended period, all CIDs that haven't been reprovided within the configured reprovide interval are immediately queued for reproviding when the node starts up. This ensures content availability is maintained even after downtime.
- **Persistent provide queue**: The provide queue is persisted to the datastore on shutdown. When the node restarts, queued CIDs are restored and provided as expected, preventing loss of pending provide operations.
- **Resume control**: The resume behavior is controlled via [`Provide.DHT.ResumeEnabled`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#providedhtresumeenabled) (default: `true`). Set to `false` if you don't want to keep the persisted provider state from a previous run.

This feature improves reliability for nodes that experience intermittent connectivity or restarts.

#### 📊 Detailed statistics with `ipfs provide stat`

The Sweep provider system now exposes detailed statistics through `ipfs provide stat`, helping you monitor provider health and troubleshoot issues.

Run `ipfs provide stat` for a quick summary, or use `--all` to see complete metrics including connectivity status, queue sizes, reprovide schedules, network statistics, operation rates, and worker utilization. For real-time monitoring, use `watch ipfs provide stat --all --compact` to observe changes in a 2-column layout. Individual sections can be displayed with flags like `--network`, `--operations`, or `--workers`.

For Dual DHT configurations, use `--lan` to view LAN DHT statistics instead of the default WAN DHT stats.

For more information, run `ipfs provide stat --help` or see the [Provide Stats documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/provide-stats.md), including [Capacity Planning](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/provide-stats.md#capacity-planning).

> [!NOTE]
> Legacy provider (when `Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled=false`) shows basic statistics without flag support.

#### 🔔 Slow reprovide warnings

Kubo now monitors DHT reprovide operations when `Provide.DHT.SweepEnabled=true`
and alerts you if your node is falling behind on reprovides.

When the reprovide queue consistently grows and all periodic workers are busy,
a warning displays with:

- Queue size and worker utilization details
- Recommended solutions: increase `Provide.DHT.MaxWorkers` or `Provide.DHT.DedicatedPeriodicWorkers`
- Command to monitor real-time progress: `watch ipfs provide stat --all --compact`

The alert polls every 15 minutes (to avoid alert fatigue while catching
persistent issues) and only triggers after sustained growth across multiple
intervals. The legacy provider is unaffected by this change.

#### 📊 Metric rename: `provider_provides_total`

The Amino DHT Sweep provider metric has been renamed from `total_provide_count_total` to `provider_provides_total` to follow OpenTelemetry naming conventions and maintain consistency with other kad-dht metrics (which use dot notation like `rpc.inbound.messages`, `rpc.outbound.requests`, etc.).

**Migration:** If you have Prometheus queries, dashboards, or alerts monitoring the old `total_provide_count_total` metric, update them to use `provider_provides_total` instead. This affects all nodes using sweep mode, which is now the default in v0.39 (previously opt-in experimental in v0.38).

#### 🔧 Automatic UPnP recovery after router restarts

Kubo now automatically recovers UPnP port mappings when routers restart or
become temporarily unavailable, fixing a critical connectivity issue that
affected self-hosted nodes behind NAT.

**Previous behavior:** When a UPnP-enabled router restarted, Kubo would lose
its port mapping and fail to re-establish it automatically. Nodes would become
unreachable to the network until the daemon was manually restarted, forcing
reliance on relay connections which degraded performance.

**New behavior:** The upgraded go-libp2p (v0.44.0) includes [Shipyard's fix](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/3367)
for self-healing NAT mappings that automatically rediscover and re-establish
port forwarding after router events. Nodes now maintain public connectivity
without manual intervention.

> [!NOTE]
> If your node runs behind a router and you haven't manually configured port
> forwarding, make sure [`Swarm.DisableNatPortMap=false`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmdisablenatportmap)
> so UPnP can automatically handle port mapping (this is the default).

This significantly improves reliability for desktop and self-hosted IPFS nodes
using UPnP for NAT traversal.

#### 🪦 Deprecated `go-ipfs` name no longer published

The `go-ipfs` name was deprecated in 2022 and renamed to `kubo`. Starting with this release, the legacy Docker image name has been replaced with a stub that displays an error message directing users to switch to `ipfs/kubo`.

**Docker images:** The `ipfs/go-ipfs` image tags now contain only a stub script that exits with an error, instructing users to update their Docker configurations to use [`ipfs/kubo`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo) instead. This ensures users are aware of the deprecation while allowing existing automation to fail explicitly rather than silently using outdated images.

**Distribution binaries:** Download Kubo from <https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/> or <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases>. The legacy `go-ipfs` distribution path should no longer be used.

All users should migrate to the `kubo` name in their scripts and configurations.

#### 🚦 Gateway range request limits for CDN compatibility

The new [`Gateway.MaxRangeRequestFileSize`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaymaxrangerequestfilesize) configuration protects against CDN range request limitations that cause bandwidth overcharges on deserialized responses. Some CDNs convert range requests over large files into full file downloads, causing clients requesting small byte ranges to unknowingly download entire multi-gigabyte files.

This only impacts deserialized responses. Clients using verifiable block requests (`application/vnd.ipld.raw`) are not affected. See the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaymaxrangerequestfilesize) for details.

#### 🖥️ RISC-V support with prebuilt binaries

Kubo provides official `linux-riscv64` prebuilt binaries, bringing IPFS to [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) open hardware.

As RISC-V single-board computers and embedded systems become more accessible, the distributed web is now supported on open hardware architectures - a natural pairing of open technologies.

Download from <https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/> or <https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases> and look for the `linux-riscv64` archive.
