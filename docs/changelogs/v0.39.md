### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🚦 Gateway range request limits for CDN compatibility

The new [`Gateway.MaxRangeRequestFileSize`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaymaxrangerequestfilesize) configuration protects against CDN bugs where range requests over a certain size are silently ignored and the entire file is returned instead ([boxo#856](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/issues/856#issuecomment-2786431369)). This causes unexpected bandwidth costs for both gateway operators and clients who only wanted a small byte range.

Set this to your CDN's range request limit (e.g., `"5GiB"` for Cloudflare's default plan) to return 501 Not Implemented for oversized range requests, with an error message suggesting verifiable block requests as an alternative.
