### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### 🪦 Deprecated `go-ipfs` name no longer published

The `go-ipfs` name was deprecated in 2022 and renamed to `kubo`. Starting with this release, we have stopped publishing Docker images and distribution binaries under the old `go-ipfs` name.

Existing users should switch to:
- Docker: `ipfs/kubo` image (instead of `ipfs/go-ipfs`)
- Binaries: download from https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/ or https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases

For Docker users, the legacy `ipfs/go-ipfs` image name now shows a deprecation notice directing you to `ipfs/kubo`.

### 📦️ Important dependency updates

- update `go-ds-pebble` to [v0.5.3](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-pebble/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
