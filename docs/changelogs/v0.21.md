### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Saving previously seen nodes for later bootstrapping

Kubo now stores a subset of connected peers as backup bootstrap nodes ([kubo#8856](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/8856)).
These nodes are used in addition to the explicitly defined bootstrappers in the
[`Bootstrap`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#bootstrap) configuration.

This enhancement improves the resiliency of the system, as it eliminates the
necessity of relying solely on the default bootstrappers operated by Protocol
Labs for joining the public IPFS swarm. Previously, this level of robustness
was only available in LAN contexts with [mDNS peer discovery](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#discoverymdns)
enabled.

With this update, the same level of robustness is applied to peers that lack
mDNS peers and solely rely on the public DHT.
