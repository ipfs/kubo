### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Saving previously seen nodes for later bootstrapping

Kubo now stores a subset of connected peers as backup bootstrap nodes ([kubo#8856](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/8856)).
These nodes are used in addition to the explicitly defined bootstrappers in the
[`Bootstrap`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#bootstrap) configuration.

This enhancement improves the resiliency of the system, as it eliminates the
necessity of relying solely on the default bootstrappers operated by Protocol
Labs for joining the public IPFS swarm. Previously, this level of robustness
was only available in LAN contexts with [mDNS peer discovery](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#discoverymdns)
enabled.

With this update, the same level of robustness is applied to peers that lack
mDNS peers and solely rely on the public DHT.

#### `Gateway.DeserializedResponses` config flag

This release introduces the
[`Gateway.DeserializedResponses`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaydeserializedresponses)
configuration flag.

With this flag, one can explicitly configure whether the gateway responds to
deserialized requests or not. By default, this flag is enabled.

Disabling deserialized responses allows the
gateway to operate
as a [Trustless Gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/)
limited to three [verifiable](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval)
response types:
[application/vnd.ipld.raw](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.raw),
[application/vnd.ipld.car](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car),
and [application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record).

With deserialized responses disabled, the Kubo gateway can serve as a block
backend for other software (like
[bifrost-gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/bifrost-gateway#readme),
[IPFS in Chromium](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/blob/main/README.md)
etc) without the usual risks associated with hosting deserialized data behind
third-party CIDs.

#### `client/rpc` migration of `go-ipfs-http-client`

The [`go-ipfs-http-client`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-http-client) RPC has
been migrated into [`client/rpc`](./client/rpc).

With this change the two will be kept in sync, in some previous releases we
updated the CoreAPI with new Kubo features but forgot to port thoses to the
http-client, making it impossible to use them together with the same coreapi
version.

For smooth transition `v0.7.0` of `go-ipfs-http-client` provides updated stubs
for Kubo `v0.21`.
