### Overview

### üî¶ Highlights

#### Saving previously seen nodes for later bootstrapping

Kubo now stores a subset of connected peers as backup bootstrap nodes ([kubo#8856](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/8856)).
These nodes are used in addition to the explicitly defined bootstrappers in the
[`Bootstrap`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#bootstrap) configuration.

This enhancement improves the resiliency of the system, as it eliminates the
necessity of relying solely on the default bootstrappers operated by Protocol
Labs for joining the public IPFS swarm. Previously, this level of robustness
was only available in LAN contexts with [mDNS peer discovery](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#discoverymdns)
enabled.

With this update, the same level of robustness is applied to peers that lack
mDNS peers and solely rely on the public DHT.

#### Gateway: `DeserializedResponses` config flag

This release introduces the
[`Gateway.DeserializedResponses`](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gatewaydeserializedresponses)
configuration flag.

With this flag, one can explicitly configure whether the gateway responds to
deserialized requests or not. By default, this flag is enabled.

Disabling deserialized responses allows the
gateway to operate
as a [Trustless Gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/)
limited to three [verifiable](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval)
response types:
[application/vnd.ipld.raw](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.raw),
[application/vnd.ipld.car](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car),
and [application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record).

With deserialized responses disabled, the Kubo gateway can serve as a block
backend for other software (like
[bifrost-gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/bifrost-gateway#readme),
[IPFS in Chromium](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium/blob/main/README.md)
etc) without the usual risks associated with hosting deserialized data behind
third-party CIDs.

#### `client/rpc` migration of `go-ipfs-http-client`

The [`go-ipfs-http-client`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-http-client) RPC has
been migrated into [`kubo/client/rpc`](../../client/rpc).

With this change the two will be kept in sync, in some previous releases we
updated the CoreAPI with new Kubo features but forgot to port thoses to the
http-client, making it impossible to use them together with the same coreapi
version.

For smooth transition `v0.7.0` of `go-ipfs-http-client` provides updated stubs
for Kubo `v0.21`.

#### Gateway: DAG-CBOR/-JSON previews and improved error pages

In this release, we improved the HTML templates of our HTTP gateway:

1. You can now preview the contents of a DAG-CBOR and DAG-JSON document from your browser, as well as follow any IPLD Links ([CBOR Tag 42](https://github.com/ipld/cid-cbor/)) contained within them. 
2. The HTML directory listings now contain [updated, higher-definition icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/241224419-5385793a-d3bb-40aa-8cb0-0382b5bc56a0.png).
3. On gateway error, instead of a plain text error message, web browsers will now get a friendly HTML response with more details regarding the problem.

HTML responses are returned when request's `Accept` header includes `text/html`.

#### Gateway: subdomain redirects are now `text/html`

HTTP 301 redirects [from path to subdomain](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/subdomain-gateway/#migrating-from-path-to-subdomain-gateway)
no longer include the target data in the body.
The data is returned only once, with the final HTTP 200 returned from the
target subdomain.

The HTTP 301 body now includes human-readable `text/html` message
for clients that do not follow redirects by default:

```console
$ curl "https://subdomain-gw.example.net/ipfs/${cid}/"
<a href="http://${cid}.ipfs.subdomain-gw.example.net/">Moved Permanently</a>.
```

Rationale can be found in [kubo#9913](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9913).
