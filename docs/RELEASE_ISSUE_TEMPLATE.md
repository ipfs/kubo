## ‚úÖ Release Checklist

Checklist:

- [ ] **Stage 0 - Prerequisites**
  - [ ] Open an issue against [bifrost-infra](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra) ahead of the release ([example](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra/issues/2109)).  **Idealy, do this multiple days in advance of the RC** to give Bifrost the heads up that asks will be coming their way.
    - [ ] Spell out all that we want updated - gateways, the bootstraper and the cluster/preload nodes
    - [ ] Mention @protocol/bifrost-team in the issue and let them know the expected date of the release
      - Issue link:
  - [ ] Ensure that the `What's left for release` section has all the checkboxes checked. If that's not the case, discuss the open items with Kubo maintainers and update the release schedule accordingly.
  - [ ] Create `docs-release-vX.Y.Z` branch, open a draft PR and keep updating `docs/RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` on that branch as you go.
      - [ ] Link it in the "Meta" section above.
  - [ ] Ensure you have a [GPG key generated](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key) and [added to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account). This will enable you to created signed tags.
  - [ ] Ensure you have [admin access](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/g/admins) to [IPFS Discourse](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/). Admin access is required to globally pin posts and create banners. @2color might be able to assist you.
  - [ ] Access to [#bifrost](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03MMMF606T) channel in FIL Slack might come in handy. Ask the release reviewer to invite you over.
  - [ ] Access to [#shared-pl-marketing-requests](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C018EJ8LWH1) channel in FIL Slack will be required to request social shares. Ask the release reviewer to invite you over.
  - [ ] After the release is deployed to our internal infrastructure, you're going to need read access to [IPFS network metrics](https://github.com/protocol/pldw/blob/624f47cf4ec14ad2cec6adf601a9f7b203ef770d/docs/sources/ipfs.md#ipfs-network-metrics) dashboards. Open an access request in https://github.com/protocol/pldw/issues/new/choose if you don't have it yet ([example](https://github.com/protocol/pldw/issues/158)).
  - [ ] You're also going to need NPM installed on your system. See [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for instructions.
  - [ ] Prepare changelog proposal in [docs/changelogs/vX.Y.md](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/).
    - Skip filling out the `### Changelog` section (the one where which lists all the commits and contributors) for now. We will populate it after the release branch is cut.
    - PR link:
  - [ ] Ensure the new changelog is linked in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.
  - [ ] Install ZSH ([instructions](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH#install-and-set-up-zsh-as-default)). It is needed by the changelog creation script.
  - [ ] Ensure you have `kubo` checked out under `$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs/kubo`. This is required by the changelog creation script.
    - If you want your clone to live in a different location, you can symlink it to the expected location by running `mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs && ln -s $(pwd) $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs/kubo`.
  - [ ] Ensure that [README.md](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/README.md) is up to date.
- [ ] **Stage 1 - Initial Preparations**
  - [ ] Upgrade to the latest patch release of Go that CircleCI has published (currently used version: `1.19.1`)
    - [ ] See the list here: https://hub.docker.com/r/cimg/go/tags
    - [ ] [ipfs/distributions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions): bump [this version](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions/blob/master/.tool-versions#L2)
    - [ ] [ipfs/kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo): [example PR](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/8599)
    - [ ] [ipfs/ipfs-docs](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs): [example PR](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/pull/1298) - only if the major version changed
  - [ ] Fork a new branch (`release-vX.Y.Z`) from `master`.
  - [ ] Bump the version in `version.go` in the `master` branch to `vX.(Y+1).0-dev` via a PR ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9305)).
- [ ] **Stage 2 - Release Candidate** - _if any [non-trivial](docs/releases.md#footnotes) changes need to be included in the release, return to this stage_
  - [ ] If it's not a first RC, add new commits to the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch from `master` using `git cherry-pick -x ...`
      - Note: `release-*` branches are protected. You can do all needed updates on a separated branch (e.g. `wip-release-vX.Y.Z`) and when everything is settled push to `release-vX.Y.Z`
  - [ ] Bump the version in `version.go` in the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch to `vX.Y.Z-rcN`.
  - [ ] If it's a first RC, create a draft PR targetting `release` branch if it doesn't exist yet ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9306)).
  - [ ] Wait for CI to run and complete PR checks. All checks should pass.
  - [ ] Create a signed tag for the release candidate.
    - [ ] This is a dangerous operation, as it is difficult to reverse due to Go modules and automated Docker image publishing. Remember to verify the commands you intend to run for items marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è with the release reviewer.
    - [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Tag HEAD `release-vX.Y.Z` commit with `vX.Y.Z-rcN` (`git tag -s vX.Y.Z-rcN -m 'Pre-release X.Y.Z-rcn'`)
    - [ ] Run `git show vX.Y.Z-rcN` to ensure the tag is correct.
    - [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Push the `vX.Y.Z-rcN` tag to GitHub (`git push origin vX.Y.Z-rcN`; DO NOT USE `git push --tags` because it pushes all your local tags).
  - [ ] Add artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.tech by making a PR against [ipfs/distributions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions)
    - [ ] Clone the `ipfs/distributions` repo locally.
    - [ ] Create a new branch (`kubo-release-vX.Y.Z-rcn`) from `master`.
    - [ ] Run `./dist.sh add-version kubo vX.Y.Z-rcN` to add the new version to the `versions` file ([instructions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions#usage)).
      - `dist.sh` will print _WARNING: not marking pre-release kubo vX.Y.Z-rcN as the current version._.
    - [ ] Push the `kubo-release-vX.Y.Z-rcn` branch to GitHub and create a PR from that branch ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions/pull/760)).
    - [ ] Ask for a review from the release reviewer.
    - [ ] Enable auto-merge for the PR.
      - PR build will build the artifacts and generate a diff in around 30 minutes
      - PR will be merged automatically once the diff is approved
      - `master` build will publish the artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.io in around 30 minutes
    - [ ] Ensure that the artifacts are available at https://dist.ipfs.io
  - [ ] Publish the RC to [the NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/go-ipfs?activeTab=versions) by running https://github.com/ipfs/npm-go-ipfs/actions/workflows/main.yml (it happens automatically but it is safe to speed up the process and kick of a run manually)
  - [ ] Cut a pre-release on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases) ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release), [example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.17.0-rc1))

    - Check `This is a pre-release`.
  - [ ] Synchronize release artifacts by running [sync-release-assets](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/actions/workflows/sync-release-assets.yml) workflow.
  - [ ] Announce the RC
    - [ ] Create a new post on [IPFS Discourse](https://discuss.ipfs.tech). ([example](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/kubo-v0-16-0-rc1-release-candidate-is-out/15248))
      - Use `Kubo vX.Y.Z-rcn Release Candidate is out!` as the title.
      - Use `kubo` and `go-ipfs` as topics.
      - Repeat the title as a heading (`##`) in the description.
      - Link to the GitHub Release, binaries on IPNS, docker pull command and release notes in the description.
    - [ ] Pin the topic globally so that it stays at the top of the category.
    - [ ] If there is no more important banner currently set on Discourse (e.g. IPFS Camp announcement), make the topic into a banner.
    - [ ] Check if Discourse post was automatically copied to:
      - [ ] IPFS Discord #ipfs-chatter
      - [ ] FIL Slack #ipfs-chatter
      - [ ] Matrix https://matrix.to/#/#ipfs-chatter:ipfs.io
    - [ ] Mention [early testers](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/docs/EARLY_TESTERS.md) in the comment under the release issue ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9319#issuecomment-1311002478)).
- [ ] **Stage 3 - Internal Testing**
  - [ ] Infrastructure Testing.
    - [ ] Update the issue against [bifrost-infra](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra) ([example](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra/issues/2109)).
      - [ ] Mention @protocol/bifrost-team in the issue to let them know the release is ready
      - [ ] [Optional] Reply under a message about the issue in the #bifrost channel on FIL Slack once the RC is out. Send the message to the channel.
    - [ ] Check [metrics](https://protocollabs.grafana.net/d/8zlhkKTZk/gateway-slis-precomputed?orgId=1) every day.
      - Compare the metrics trends week over week.
      - If there is an unexpected variation in the trend, message the #bifrost channel on FIL Slack and ask for help investigation the cause.
  - [ ] IPFS Application Testing.
    - [ ] [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop)
      - [ ] Upgrade to the RC in [ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop)
      - [ ] Run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`.
      - [ ] Push to a branch ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/pull/1826/commits/b0a23db31ce942b46d95965ee6fe770fb24d6bde))
      - [ ] Open a draft PR to track through the final release ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/pull/1826))
      - [ ] Ensure CI tests pass
    - [ ] [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion)
      - [ ] Start kubo daemon of the version to release.
      - [ ] Start a fresh chromium or chrome instance using `chromium --user-data-dir=$(mktemp -d)` (macos `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --user-data-dir=$(mktemp -d)`)
      - [ ] Start a fresh firefox instance using `firefox --profile $(mktemp -d)` (macos `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox --profile $(mktemp -d)`)
      - [ ] Install IPFS Companion from [vendor-specific store](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/#readme).
      - [ ] Check that the comunication between Kubo daemon and IPFS companion is working properly checking if the number of connected peers changes.
- [ ] **Stage 5 - Release** - _ONLY FOR FINAL RELEASE_
  - [ ] Prepare the `release` branch.
    - [ ] Bump the version in `version.go` in the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch to `X.Y.Z`.
    - [ ] Update the [docs/changelogs/vX.Y.md](docs/changelogs) with the new commits and contributors.
      - [ ] Run `./bin/mkreleaselog` twice to generate the changelog and copy the output.
