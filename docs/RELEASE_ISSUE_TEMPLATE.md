### The release

This section covers tasks to be done during each release.

- [ ] Prepare the release branch and update version numbers accordingly <details><summary>using `./kuboreleaser --skip-check-before release --version vX.Y.Z(-rcN) prepare-branch` or ...</summary>
  - [ ] create a new branch `release-vX.Y.Z`
    - use `master` as base if `Z == 0`
    - use `release` as base if `Z > 0`
  - [ ] ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/only-RC-blue?style=flat-square) update the `CurrentVersionNumber` in [version.go](version.go) in the `master` branch to `vX.Y+1.0-dev`
    - [example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9305)
  - [ ] update the `CurrentVersionNumber` in [version.go](version.go) in the `release-vX.Y` branch to `vX.Y.Z(-RCN)`
    - [example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9394)
  - [ ] create a draft PR from `release-vX.Y` to `release`
    - [example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9306)
  - [ ] Cherry-pick commits from `master` to the `release-vX.Y.Z` using `git cherry-pick -x <commit>`
  - [ ] ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/only-FINAL-green?style=flat-square) Add full changelog and contributors to the [changelog](docs/changelogs/vX.Y.md)
    - [ ] ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/only-FINAL-green?style=flat-square) Replace the `Changelog` and `Contributors` sections of the [changelog](docs/changelogs/vX.Y.md) with the stdout of `./bin/mkreleaselog`

  - [ ] verify all CI checks on the PR from `release-vX.Y` to `release` are passing
  - [ ] ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/only-FINAL-green?style=flat-square) Merge the PR from `release-vX.Y` to `release` using the `Create a merge commit`
    - do **NOT** use `Squash and merge` nor `Rebase and merge` because we need to be able to sign the merge commit
    - do **NOT** delete the `release-vX.Y` branch
  </details>
- [ ] Run Thunderdome testing, see the [Thunderdome release docs](./releases_thunderdome.md) for details

  - [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/only-RC-blue?style=flat-square) tag the HEAD commit using `git tag -s vX.Y.Z(-RCN) -m 'Prerelease X.Y.Z(-RCN)'`

  - [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è verify the tag is signed and tied to the correct commit using `git show vX.Y.Z(-RCN)`
  - [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è push the tag to GitHub using `git push origin vX.Y.Z(-RCN)`
    - do **NOT** use `git push --tags` because it pushes all your local tags
  </details>
- [ ] Publish the release to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/) <details><summary>using `./kuboreleaser --skip-check-before --skip-run release --version vX.Y.Z(-rcN) publish-to-dockerhub` or ...</summary>
