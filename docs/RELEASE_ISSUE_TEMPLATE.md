# Kubo X.Y.Z Release

We're happy to announce Kubo X.Y.Z, bla bla...

As usual, this release includes important fixes, some of which may be critical for security. Unless the fix addresses a bug being exploited in the wild, the fix will _not_ be called out in the release notes. Please make sure to update ASAP. See our [release process](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/docs/releases.md#security-fix-policy) for details.

## ‚úÖ Release Checklist

For each RC published in each stage:

- version string in `version.go` has been updated (in the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch).
- new commits should be added to the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch from `master` using `git cherry-pick -x ...`
- tag commit with `vX.Y.Z-rcN`
- add artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.tech
  1. Make a PR against [ipfs/distributions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions) with local changes produced by `add-version` (see [usage](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions#usage))
  2. Wait for PR to build artifacts and generate diff
  3. Inspect results, merge if CI is green and the diff looks ok
  4. Wait for `master` branch to build and update DNSLink at https://dist.ipfs.tech
- cut a pre-release on [github](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases) and reuse signed artifacts from https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo (upload the result of the ipfs/distributions build in the previous step).
- Announce the RC:
  - [ ] 
    - This will automatically post to IPFS Discord #ipfs-chatter
    - Examples from the past: [0.14.0](https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/kubo-formerly-go-ipfs-v0-14-0-release-is-out/14794)
    - [ ] Pin the topic
  - [ ] To the _early testers_ listed in [docs/EARLY_TESTERS.md](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/docs/EARLY_TESTERS.md).  Do this by copy/pasting their GitHub usernames and checkboxes as a comment so they get a GitHub notification.  ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/8176#issuecomment-909356394))

- [ ] **Stage 3 - Release**
  - [ ] Final preparation
    - [ ] Verify that version string in [`version.go`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/version.go) has been updated.
    - [ ] Open a PR merging `release-vX.Y.Z` into the `release` branch.
      - This should be reviewed by the person who most recently released a version of `go-ipfs`.
	  - Use a merge commit (no rebase, no squash)
    - [ ] Prepare the command to use for tagging the merge commit (on the `release` branch) with `vX.Y.Z`.
      - Use `git tag -s` to ensure the tag is signed
    - [ ] Have the tagging command reviewed by the person who most recently released a version of `go-ipfs`
      - This is a dangerous operation, as it is difficult to reverse due to Go modules and automated Docker image publishing
    - [ ] Push the tag
      - Use `git push origin <tag>`
      - DO NOT USE `git push --tags`, as it will push ALL of your local tags
      - This should initiate a Docker build in GitHub Actions that publishes a `vX.Y.Z` tagged Docker image to DockerHub
    - [ ] Release published
      - [ ] to [dist.ipfs.tech](https://dist.ipfs.tech)

         - [ ] Manually run [the release workflow](https://github.com/ipfs/choco-go-ipfs/actions/workflows/main.yml)
         - [ ] Wait for Chocolatey to approve the release (usually takes a few hours)
      - [ ] to [snap](https://snapcraft.io/ipfs) (done CI at [snap/snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml))
