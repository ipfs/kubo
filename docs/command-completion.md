# Command Completion

Shell command completions can be generated by running one of the `ipfs commands completions`
sub-commands.

The simplest way to "eval" the completions logic:

```bash
> eval "$(ipfs commands completion bash)"
```

To install the completions permanently, they can be moved to
`/etc/bash_completion.d` or sourced from your `~/.bashrc` file.

## Fish

The fish shell is also supported:

The simplest way to use the completions logic:

```bash
> ipfs commands completion fish | source
```

To install the completions permanently, they can be moved to
`/etc/fish/completions` or `~/.config/fish/completions` or sourced from your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file.
