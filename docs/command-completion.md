# Command Completion

Shell command completions can be generated by running one of the `ipfs commands completions`
sub-commands.

The simplest way to "eval" the completions logic:

```bash
> eval "$(ipfs commands completion bash)"
```

To install the completions permanently, they can be moved to
`/etc/bash_completion.d` or sourced from your `~/.bashrc` file.
