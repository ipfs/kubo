# Plugins

Since 0.4.11 go-ipfs has an experimental plugin system that allows augmenting
the daemons functionality without recompiling.

When an IPFS node is started, it will load plugins from the `$IPFS_PATH/plugins`
directory (by default `~/.ipfs/plugins`).

## Plugin Types

Plugins can implement one or more plugin types, defined in the
[plugin](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/plugin) package.

### IPLD

IPLD plugins add support for additional formats to `ipfs dag` and other IPLD
related commands.

### Datastore

Datastore plugins add support for additional datastore backends.

### Tracer

(experimental)

Tracer plugins allow injecting an opentracing backend into go-ipfs.

### Daemon

Daemon plugins are started when the go-ipfs daemon is started and are given an
instance of the CoreAPI. This should make it possible to build an ipfs-based
application without IPC and without forking go-ipfs.

Note: We eventually plan to make go-ipfs usable as a library. However, this
plugin type is likely the best interim solution.

### Internal

(never stable)

Internal plugins are like daemon plugins _except_ that they can access, replace,
and modify all internal state. Use this plugin type to extend go-ipfs in
arbitrary ways. However, be aware that your plugin will likely break every time
go-ipfs updated.

* **Preloaded** plugins are built into the go-ipfs binary and do not need to be
  installed separately. At the moment, all in-tree plugins are preloaded.

## Installing Plugins

Go-ipfs supports two types of plugins: External and Preloaded.

* External plugins must be installed in `$IPFS_PATH/plugins/` (usually
`~/.ipfs/plugins/`).
* Preloaded plugins are built-into the go-ipfs when it's compiled.

### External Plugin

The advantage of an external plugin is that it can be built, packaged, and
installed independently of go-ipfs. Unfortunately, this method is only supported
on Linux and MacOS at the moment. Users of other operating systems should follow
the instructions for preloaded plugins.

#### In-tree

To build plugins included in
[plugin/plugins](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/plugin/plugins),
run:

```bash
go-ipfs$ make build_plugins
go-ipfs$ ls plugin/plugins/*.so
```

To install, copy desired plugins to `$IPFS_PATH/plugins`. For example:

```bash
go-ipfs$ mkdir -p ~/.ipfs/plugins/
go-ipfs$ cp plugin/plugins/git.so ~/.ipfs/plugins/
go-ipfs$ chmod +x ~/.ipfs/plugins/git.so # ensure plugin is executable
```

Finally, restart daemon if it is running.

#### Out-of-tree

To build out-of-tree plugins, use the plugin's Makefile if provided. Otherwise,
you can manually build the plugin by running:

```bash
myplugin$ go build -buildmode=plugin -i -o myplugin.so myplugin.go
```

Finally, as with in-tree plugins:

1. Install the plugin in `$IPFS_PATH/plugins`.
2. Mark the plugin as executable (`chmod +x $IPFS_PATH/plugins/myplugin.so`).
3. Restart your IPFS daemon (if running).

### Preloaded Plugins

The advantages of preloaded plugins are:

1. They're bundled with the go-ipfs binary.
2. They work on all platforms.

To preload a go-ipfs plugin:

1. Add the plugin to the preload list: `plugin/loader/preload_list`
2. Build ipfs
```bash
go-ipfs$ make build
```

You can also preload an in-tree but disabled-by-default plugin by adding it to
the IPFS_PLUGINS variable. For example, to enable plugins foo, bar, and baz:

```bash
go-ipfs$ make build IPFS_PLUGINS="foo bar baz"
```

## Creating A Plugin

To create your own out-of-tree plugin, use the [example
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-example-plugin/) as a starting point.
When you're ready, submit a PR adding it to the list of [available
plugins](#available-plugins).
